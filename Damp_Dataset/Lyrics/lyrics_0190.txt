And even though the moment passed me by, I still can't turn away.
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
got tossed along the way.
Letters that you never meant to send,
got lost or blown away.
And now we're grown up orphans, and never knew their names,
we don't belong to no one, that's a shame.
You could hide beside me, maybe for a while,
and I won't tell no one your name.
And I won't tell 'em your name.
Scars are souvenirs you never lose, the past is never far.
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
is more than who we are?
You grew up way too fast, and now there's nothing to believe,
and reruns all become our history.
A tired song keeps playin' on a tired radio,
and I won't tell no one your name.
And I won't tell 'em your name.
I won't tell 'em your name.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
I won't tell 'em your name.
Oww!
I think about you all the time, but I don't need the same.
It's ly where you are, come back down,
and I won't tell 'em your name.
