You can dance
every dance with the guy who gives you the eye,
let him hold you tight.
You can smile
every smile for the man who held your hand
'neath the pale moonlight.
But don't forget who's taking you home
and in whose arms you're gonna be.
So darlin',
save the last dance for me,
mmm.
Oh, I know
that the music is fine like sparkling wine,
go and have your fun.
Laugh and sing,
but while we're apart don't give your heart
to anyone.
But don't forget who's taking you home
and in whose arms you're gonna be.
So darlin',
save the last dance for me,
mmm.
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go,
I love you oh so much.
You can dance,
go and carry on 'til the night is gone
and it's time to go.
If he asks
if you're all alone, can he take you home,
you must tell him no.
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
and in whose arms you're gonna be.
So darlin',
save the last dance for me.
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
and in whose arms you're gonna be.
So darlin',
save the last dance for me,
mmm.
Save...
the last dance for me,
mmm.
Save...
the last dance for me,
mmm.
