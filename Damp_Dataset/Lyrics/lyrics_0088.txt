Baby are you down down down down down?
Even if the sky is falling down

You oughta know
Tonight's the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control
So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape

So baby don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down down down down down?
Baby are you down down down down down?
Even if the sky is falling...

Down like she s'posed to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature 'cause to me she's zero degress
She cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas, now she my miss America
Now can I be her soldier please?
I'm fighting for this girl on the battle field of love
Don't it look like baby cupid sending arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly I'm down like the economy

So baby don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down down down down down?
Baby are you down down down down down?

Even if the sky is falling down
Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away, hey
Turn this place into our private getaway
So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape
So why don't we run away?

Don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down down down down down?
Down, are you down, are you down, oooh
Oooh, and the sky is falling down

Oooh, oooh, and the sky is falling down
