Da da da 'n da da.
Da da da 'n da da.
Da da da 'n da da da da.
Da da da 'n da da.
Da da da 'n da da.
Da da da 'n da da da da.

Grew up in a small town
and when the rain would fall down

I would just stare out my window
dreaming of what could be.
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray,

trying hard to reach out.
But when I tried to speak out,

felt like no one could hear me.
Wanted to belong here
but something felt so wrong here.

So I prayed I could break away.

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.

Make a wish,
take a chance,
make a change
and break away!

Out of the darkness and into the sun,
but I won't forget all the ones that I love.

Take a risk,
take a chance,
make a change
and break away!

Da da da 'n da da.
Da da da 'n da da.
Da da da 'n da da da da.

Wanna feel the warm breeze,
sleep under a palm tree,

feel the rush of the ocean.
Get on board a fast train,
travel on a jet plane far away,

and break away!

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky!

Make a wish,
take a chance,
make a change
and break away!

Out of the darkness and into the sun,
but I won't forget all the ones that I love.

Take a risk,
take a chance,
make a change
and break away!

Buildings with a hundred floors,
swingin' 'round revolving doors.
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but...
gotta keep movin' on, movin' on.
Fly away, break away!

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly,
though it's not easy to tell you goodbye.

Take a risk,
take a chance,
make a change
and break away!

Out of the darkness and into the sun,
but I won't forget the place I come from.

Take a risk,
take a chance,
make a change
and break away!

Break away!
Break away!
