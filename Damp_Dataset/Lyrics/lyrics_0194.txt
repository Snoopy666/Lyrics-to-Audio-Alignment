Some things we don't talk about,
rather do without.
Just hold the smile.

Falling in and out of love.
The same damn problem.
Together all the while.
You can never say never while we don't know when.

But time and time again, younger now than we were before...
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go...

Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go...

Picture, you're the queen of everything,
as far as the eye can see,
under your command.

I will be your gaurdian.
When all is crumbling,
I'll steady your hand.
You can never say never while we don't know when.
But time, time, time again,

younger now than we were before...
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go...

Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go...

We're falling apart and coming together again and again.
We're growing apart, but we pull it together,
pull it together, together again...
Oooooh...
Oooh...

Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go...

Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go...

Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.
Don't let me go...

Don't let me go.
Don't let me go.

Don't let me go...
