Oooooh...

I can show you the world,
shining, shimmering, splendid.
Tell me princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes,
take you wonder by wonder.
Over, sideways, and under on a magic carpet ride.

A whole new world,
a new fantastic point of view.
No one to tell us 'No',
or where to go,
or say we're only dreaming.

A whole new world,
a dazzling place I never knew.
But now from way up here, it's crystal clear
that now I'm in a whole new world with you.

Unbelievable sights,
indescribable feelings.
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling through an endless diamond sky.

A whole new world,
a hundred thousand things to see.
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far.

I can't go back to where I used to be.
...With new horizons to pursue.
I'll chase them anywhere.
There's time to spare.

Let me share this whole new world with you.
Oooooh,

a whole new world,
a new fantastic point of view.
No one to tell us 'No',
or where to go,
or say we're only dreaming.

A whole new world
with new horizons to pursue.
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare.
Anywhere...
there's time to spare...
Let me share...
this whole new world with you.

A whole new world,
a whole new world.
That's where we'll be,
where we will be.
A thrilling chase,
a wondrous place,
for you and me.
Oh, yeah.
