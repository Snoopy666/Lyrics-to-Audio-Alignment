The seaweed is always greener
in somebody else's lake.
You dream about going up there,
but that is a big mistake.
Just look at the world around you
right here on the ocean floor.
Such wonderful things surround you!
What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea,
under the sea!
Darling it's better
down where it's wetter,
take it from me!
Up on the shore, they work all day!
Out in the sun, they slave away!
While we devotin'
full-time to floatin'

under the sea!

Down here all the fish is happy,
as off through the waves they roll.
The fish on the land ain't happy,
they sad 'cause they in their bowl.
But fish in the bowl is lucky,
they in for a worser fate...
One day when the boss get hungry,
Guess who's gon' be on the plate!

Under the sea,
under the sea!
Nobody beat us,
fry us and eat us
in fricassee!
We what the land folks love to cook,
under the sea, we off the hook!
We got no troubles,
life is the bubbles

under the sea!
Under the sea!
Since life is sweet here,
we got the beat here
naturally!
Even the sturgeon and the ray,
they get the urge and start to play!
We got the spirit,
you got to hear it
under the sea!

The newt play the flute, the carp play the harp,
the plaice play the bass and they soundin' sharp!
The bass play the brass, the chub play the tub,
the fluke is the duke of soul!
The ray he can play, the lings on the strings,
the trout rockin' out, the blackfish she sings,
the smelt and the sprat, they know where it's at,
and oh that blowfish blow!!!



Under the sea,
under the sea!
When the sardine begin the biguine,
it's music to me!
What do they got? A lot of sand.
We got a hot crustacean band!
Each little clam here
know how to jam here
under the sea!

Each little slug here
cuttin' a rug here
under the sea!

Each little snail here
know how to wail here.
That's why it's hotter
under the water!
Yeah, we in luck here
down in the muck here

under the sea!
