I don't practice Santeria,
I ain't got no crystal ball.
Well I had a million dollars, but I...
I'd spend it all!
If I could find that Heina and that Sancho that she's found,
well I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down.
What I really wanna know, my baby,
what I really want to say I can't define.
Well it's love that I need,
oh, my soul will have to wait 'til I get back, find a Heina of my own.
Daddy's gonna love one and all!
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break, and I got live it out.
Oh yeah, huh,
Well I swear that I...
What I really wanna know, my baby,
what I really want to say I can't define.
Got love, make it go!
My soul will have to...
Oooh, what I really wanna say, my baby,
What I really want to say is I've got mine.
And I'll make it, yes, I'm coming up!
Tell Sanchito that if he knows what is good for him, he best go run and hide,
daddy's got a new .45!
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat.
Believe me when I say
that I got somethin' for his punk ass!
What I really wanna know, my baby,
what I really want to say is there's just one way back,
and I'll make it, yeah,
my soul will have to wait.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
