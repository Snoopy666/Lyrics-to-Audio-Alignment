You know I'd fall apart without you,
I don't know how you do what you do.

'Cause everything that don't make sense about me,
makes sense when I'm with you.

Like everything that's green, girl, I need you,
but it's more than one and one makes two.

Put aside the math and the logic of it,
you gotta know you're wanted, too.

'Cause I wanna wrap you up, wanna kiss your lips,
I wanna make you feel wanted.

And I wanna call you mine, wanna hold your hand forever,
and never let you forget it.


Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted.

Anyone can tell you you're pretty,
and you get that all the time,
I know you do.

But your beauty's deeper than the makeup,
and I wanna show you what I see tonight.

When I wrap you up, when I kiss your lips,
I wanna make you feel wanted.

And I wanna call you mine, wanna hold your hand forever,
and never let you forget it.

'Cause baby, I wanna make you feel wanted.

As good as you make me feel,
I wanna make you feel better.
Better than your fairy tales,
better than your best dreams,
you're more than everything I need.
You're all I ever wanted,
all I ever wanted.

And I just wanna wrap you up, wanna kiss your lips,
I wanna make you feel wanted.

And I wanna call you mine, wanna hold your hand forever,
and never let you forget it.

Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted,

baby, I wanna make you feel...
Wanted.
You'll always be wanted.
