Two black Cadillacs drivin' in a slow parade.
Headlights shinin' bright in the middle of the day.
One is for his wife,
the other for the woman who loved him at night.
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time.
And the preacher said he was a good man,
and his brother said he was a good friend.
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry.
Yeah they took turns layin' a rose down,
threw a handfull of dirt into the deep ground.
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide.
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!
Two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone.
Turns out he'd been lyin' to both of them for oh so long!
They decided then, he'd never get away with doin' this to them.
Two black Cadillacs waitin' for the right time.
The right time, time time!
And the preacher said he was a good man,
and his brother said he was a good friend.
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry.
Yeah they took turns layin' a rose down,
threw a handfull of dirt into the deep ground.
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide.
Bye bye, bye bye.
Bye bye, yeah!
It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face.
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away.
And left the secret at the grave.
And the preacher said he was a good man,
and his brother said he was a good friend.
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry.
Yeah they took turns layin' a rose down,
threw a handfull of dirt into the deep ground.
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide.
Bye bye, bye bye.
Bye bye, yeah yeah yeah!
