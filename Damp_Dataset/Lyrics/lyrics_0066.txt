Oh, oh, oh..
I feel so unsure,
as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
As the music dies,
something in your eyes,
calls to mind a silver screen,
and all its sad goodbyes.
I'm never gonna dance again,
guilty feet have got no rhythm,
though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should've known better than to cheat a friend,
and waste a chance that I've been given,
so I'm never gonna dance again,
the way I danced with you.
Oh.
Time can never mend
the careless whisper
of a good friend.
To the heart and mind,
ignorance is kind,
there's no comfort in the truth,
pain is all you'll find.
I'm never gonna dance again,
guilty feet have got no rhythm,
though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should've known better than to cheat a friend,
and waste a chance that I've been given,
so I'm never gonna dance again,
the way I danced with you, oh.
Livin' without your love.
Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose this crowd.
Maybe, it's better this way,
we'd hurt each other with the things we want to say.
We could have been so good together,
we could have lived this dance forever,
but now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay.
I'm never gonna dance again,
guilty feet have got no rhythm,
though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should've known better than to cheat a friend,
and waste a chance that I've been given,
so I'm never gonna dance again,
the way I danced with you.
Oh, oh...
Now that you've gone.
