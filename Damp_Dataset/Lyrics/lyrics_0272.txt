Uh huh, uh huh!
Rihanna,
good girl gone bad...
Take three, action!
No clouds in my stones.
Let it rain!
I hydroplane in the bank, comin' down with the Dow Jones.
When the clouds come we gone,
we Rocafella.
We fly higher than weather,
in G5's are better.
You know me,
in anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for a rainy day,
Jay, Rain man is back with little miss sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
and we'll never be worlds apart.
Maybe in magazines,
but you'll still be my star,
baby, 'cause in the dark
you can't see shiny cars.
And that's when you need me there
with you I'll always share,


because when the sun shines,
we'll shine together.
Told you I'll be here
forever.
Said I'll always be a friend,
took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end.
Now that it's rainin'
more than ever,
know that we'll still
have each other.
You can stand under my umbrella.


You can stand under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh, -eh...


These fancy things will never come in between.
You're part of my entity,
here for infinity.
When the war has took it's part,
when the world has dealt its cards,
if the hand is hard,
together we'll mend your heart.


Because when the sun shines,
we'll shine together.
Told you I'll be here
forever.
Said I'll always be a friend,
took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end.
Now that it's rainin'
more than ever,
know that we'll still
have each other.
You can stand under my umbrella.


You can stand under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh, -eh...

You can run into my arms.
It's okay, don't be alarmed, come here to me.
There's no distance in between our love.
So go on and let the rain pour, I'll be all you need and more.


Because, when the sun shines, we'll shine together.
Told you I'll be here forever.
Said I'll always be a friend,
took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end.
Now that it's rainin' more than ever,
know that we'll still have each other.
You can stand under my umbrella.


You can stand under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh...
Under my umbrella,
-ella, -ella, -eh, -eh, -eh, -eh...


It's rainin', rainin'...
Oooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'...
Baby, come here to me,
come here to me...
It's rainin', rainin'...
Oooh, baby, it's rainin', rainin'...
You can always come here to me,
come here to me...

It's pourin' rain!
It's pourin' rain!
Come here to me,
come here to me.
