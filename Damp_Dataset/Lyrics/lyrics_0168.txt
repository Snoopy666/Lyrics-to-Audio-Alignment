Much as you blame yourself,
you can't be blamed for the way that you feel.
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real.

How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh baby, if you let me,
I can help you out with all of that.

Girl, let me love you,
and I will love you
until you learn to love yourself.
Girl, let me love you,
I know your trouble.
Don't be afraid,
girl, let me help.

Girl, let me love you,
and I will love you
until your learn to love yourself.
Girl, let me love you,
a heart of darkness gets brought to light.
I'll take you there.

Let me love you,

Ooh, I can see the pain behind your eyes, it's been there for quite a while.
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile, yeah.
I would like to show you what true love can really do!

Girl, let me love you,
and I will love you
until you learn to love yourself.
Girl, let me love you,
