Hmm,
oh, oh,
oh, oh.
Oh,oh,
oh, oh.

From the day we arrive on the planet,
and blinking, step into the sun.
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen,
more to do than can ever be done.

Some say eat or be eaten,
some say live and let live.
But all are agreed,
as they join the stampede,
you should never take more than you give.

In the circle of life.
It's the wheel of fortune,
it's the leap of faith,
it's the band of hope.

'Til we find our place,
on the path unwinding.
In the circle,
the circle of life.

Some of us fall by the wayside,
and some of us soar to the stars.
And some of us sail through our troubles,
some have to live with the scars.

There's far too much to take in here,
more to find than can ever be found.
But the sun rollin' high,
through the sapphire sky,
keeps the great and small on the endless round.

In the circle of life.
It's the wheel of fortune,
it's the leap of faith,
it's the band of hope.

'Til we find our place,
on the path unwinding.
In the circle,

the circle of life.
It's the wheel of fortune,
it's the leap of faith,
it's the band of hope.

'Til we find our place,
on the path unwinding, yeah.
The circle,
the circle of life.

On the path unwinding.
It's the circle,
the circle of life.
