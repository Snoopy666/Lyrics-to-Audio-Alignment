Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring.
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun,
now the jingle hop has begun.

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time.
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square,
in the frosty air!
What a bright time, it's the right time to rock the night away.
Jingle bell time is a swell time to go gliding in a one horse sleigh.

Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet,
jingle around the clock.
Mix and minglin', jinglin' beat,
that's the jingle bell rock.

that's the jingle bell...
That's the jingle bell...
That's the jingle bell rock!
