I don't want a lot for Christmas,
there is just one thing I need.
I don't care about the presents
underneath the Christmas tree.
I just want you for my own
more than you will ever know.
Make my wish come true!


All I want for Christmas is you.
Yeah!

I don't want a lot for Christmas,
there is just one thing I need.
Don't care about those presents underneath the Christmas tree.

I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace.
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas day,
I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know.
Make my wish come true,

all I want for Christmas is you!
Ooh, baby.

I won't ask for much this Christmas, I won't even wish for snow.
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
underneath the mistletoe.

I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for St. Nick.
I won't even stay up late to hear those magical reindeers click.
I just want you here tonight, holdin' on to me so tight!
What more can I do?

All I want for Christmas is you!

Wow, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere,
and the sound of children's laughter fills the air,
and everyone is singing!
I hear those sleigh bells ringing...
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need, won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas,
this is all I'm askin' for.
I just wanna see my baby standin' right outside my door.
I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know.
Make my wish come true,

all I want for Christmas...

is you!
You!
Oh, oh, oh-oh oh-oh-oh.
Wow-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh.
Ooh-ooh, oh...
