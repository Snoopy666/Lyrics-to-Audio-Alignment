Ah, ah.
Hey...
Oh oh...
Oh, baby baby, oh, are you listening?


Wondering where you been all my life.
I just started living.


Oooh oh, baby, are you listening?
Ah, ah...


When you say you love me, know I love you more.
When you say you need me, know I need you more.


Boy, I adore you.
I adore you.

Baby, can you hear me when I'm cryin' out for you?

I'm scared, oh...
so scared.

But when you're near me, I feel like I'm standing with an army of men armed with weapons.
Hey, oh...

When you say you love me, know I love you more.
When you say you need me, know I need you more.

Boy, I adore you.
I adore you.

I love lying next to you.
I could do this for eternity,
you and me.
We're meant to be in holy matrimony.
God knew exactly what he was doin' when he led me to you.

When you say you love me, know I love you more.
When you say you need me, know I need you more.

Boy, I adore you.
I adore you.

When you say you love me, know I love you more.
When you say you need me, know I need you more.

Boy, I adore you.
I adore you.
