Call you up in the middle of the night
like a firefly without a light,
you were there like a blowtorch burning,
I was a key that could use a little turning.
So tired that I couldn't even sleep,
so many secrets I couldn't keep,
promised myself I wouldn't weep,
one more promise I couldn't keep.
It seems no one can help me now, I'm in too deep, there's no way out,
this time I have really lead myself astray.
Runaway train, never goin' back,
wrong way on a one-way track,
seems like I should be getting somewhere,
somehow I'm neither here nor there.
Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile?
How on Earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mysteries seem so faded.
I can go where no one else can go,
I know what no one else knows.
Here I am, just a-drowning in the rain,
with a ticket for a runaway train.
And everything seems cut and dry,
day and night,
Earth and sky.
Somehow I...
just don't believe it.
Runaway train, never goin' back,
wrong way on a one-way track,
seems like I should be getting somewhere,
somehow I'm neither here nor there.
Bought a ticket for a runaway train,
like a madman laughing at the rain,
a little out of touch, little insane,
it's just easier than dealing with the pain.
Runaway train, never goin' back,
wrong way on a one-way track,
seems like I should be getting somewhere,
somehow I'm neither here nor there.
Runaway train, never coming back,
runaway train, tearing up the track,
runaway train, burning in my veins,
I ran away but it always seems the same.
