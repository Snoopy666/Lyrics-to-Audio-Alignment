I got my ticket for the long way 'round.
Two bottle whiskey for the way.
And I sure would like some sweet company, and I'm leavin' tomorrow, what do you say?

When I'm gone, when I'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me by my hair, you're gonna miss me everywhere.
Oh, you're, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

When I'm gone,
when I'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me by my walk,
you're gonna miss me by my talk.
Oh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.


I've got my ticket for the long way 'round.
The one with the prettiest of views.
It's got mountains, it's got rivers,
it's got sights to give you shivers.
But it sure would be prettier with you.

When I'm gone, when I'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me by my walk, you're gonna miss me by my talk.
Oh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

When I'm gone, when I'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me by my hair, you're gonna miss me everywhere.
Oh, you're sure gonna miss me when I'm gone.

When I'm gone, when I'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
You're gonna miss me by my walk, you're gonna miss me by my talk.
Oh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
