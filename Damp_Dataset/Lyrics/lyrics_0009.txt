Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
It's not warm when she's away.

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
and she's always gone too long
anytime she goes away.

Wonder this time where she's gone?
Wonder if she's gone to stay?

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
and this house just ain't no home
anytime she goes away.

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know...
Hey, I ought 'a leave a young thing alone,
but ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
Only darkness every day.

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
and this house just ain't no home

any time she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
