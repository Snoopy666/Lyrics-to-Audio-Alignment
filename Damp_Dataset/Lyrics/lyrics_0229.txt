Sittin' in the mornin' sun,
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes.
Watching the ships roll in,
and I'll watch 'em roll away again.
Yeah, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,
watchin' the tide roll away.
Ooo, oo-oo, sittin' on the dock of the bay,
wastin' time...
I left my home in Georgia,
headed for the 'Frisco bay,
'cause I've had nothin' to live for,
and look like nothin's gonna come my way.
So, I'm just gon' sit on the dock of the bay,
watchin' the tide roll away.
Ooh, oo-oo, sittin' on the dock of the bay,
wastin' time...
Looks like nothin's gonna change,
everything still remains the same.
I can't do what ten people tell me to do,
so I guess I'll remain the same...
Sittin' here restin' my bones,
and this loneliness won't leave me alone.
That's two thousand miles I roam,
just to make this dock my home.
Now, I'm just gon' sit at the dock of the bay,
watchin' the tide roll away...
Ooo, oo-oo, sittin' on the dock of the bay,
wastin' time...
