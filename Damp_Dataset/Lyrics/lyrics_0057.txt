Baby,
don't understand,
why we can't just hold on
to each others' hands.
This time,
might be the last,
I fear,
unless I,
make it all too clear,
I need you so.
Oh.
Take
these broken wings,
and learn to fly again,
learn to live so free.
When we hear
the voices sing,
the book of love will open up,
and let us in.
Take
these broken wings.
Baby,
I think tonight,
we can take what was wrong,
and make it right.
Mmm, mmm.
Baby,
it's all I know,
that you're half of the flesh,
and blood makes me whole.
I need you so.
So take
these broken wings,
and learn to fly again,
learn to live so free.
When we hear
the voices sing,
the book of love will open up,
and let us in.
Let us in.
Baby,
it's all I know,
that you're half of the flesh,
and blood makes me whole, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So take
these broken wings,
and learn to fly again,
learn to live so free.
When we hear
the voices sing,
the book of love will open up,
and let us in.
Take these broken wings,
we've got to learn to fly,
and learn to live your life so free.
And when we hear
the voices sing,
the book of love will open up for us and let us in.
Ooh.
