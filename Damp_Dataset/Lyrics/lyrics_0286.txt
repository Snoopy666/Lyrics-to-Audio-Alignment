I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say, oh oh
The words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinkin' why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard
Hard to believe it
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night, I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
The noises that she made kept me awake
Oh, the weight of the things that remain unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us every day
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinkin' why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so cruel
Hard to believe it
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night, I won't go home without you
Oh, It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night, I won't go home without you
Oh, of all the things I felt I've never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night, I won't go home without you
Oh, it's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night, I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
