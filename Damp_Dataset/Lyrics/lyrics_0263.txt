Such a feeling's coming over me.
There is wonder in most everything I see.
Not a cloud in the sky,
got the sun in my eyes,
and I won't be surprised if it's a dream.
Everything I want the world to be,
is now coming through especially for me.
And the reason is clear,
it's because you are here,
you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen.
I'm on the top of the world looking
down on creation,
and the only explanation I can find,
is the love that I've found ever since you've been around.
Your love's put me at the top of the world.
Something in the wind has learned my name,
and it's telling me that things are not the same.
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze,
there's a pleasing sense of happiness for me.
There is only one wish on my mind,
when this day is through I hope that I will find,
that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me,
all I need will be mine if you are here.
I'm on the top of the world looking
down on creation,
and the only explanation I can find,
is the love that I've found ever since you've been around.
Your love's put me at the top of the world.
