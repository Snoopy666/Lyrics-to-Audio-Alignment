I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love, and I'm like, 'Forget you!'
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough.
I'm like, 'Forget you, and forget her, too!'

Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with you.
Huh, now ain't that some shhh...
And although there's pain in my chest,
I still wish you the best with a
'Forget you!'

Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari.
But that don't mean I can't get you there.
I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more an Atari.
Mmm, but the way you play your game ain't fair.
I pity the fool that falls in love with you.
Well.
Oooh, I got some news for you.
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend.

Now I know that I had to borrow,
beg, and steal, and lie, and cheat
trying to keep you, trying to please you,
'cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap.
I pity the fool that falls in love with you.
Well.
Oooh, I got some news for you.
Oooh, I really hate your ass right now.

Now baby, baby, baby, why you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?
So bad...
I tried to tell my mama, but she told me, this is one for your dad.
Yes, she did.
And I was like, uh!
Whhhy?
Whhhhhy!?
Why, lady?
I love you.
I still love you, oooh!

I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love...
Forget you!
