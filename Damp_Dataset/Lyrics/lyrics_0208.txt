I was left to my own devi-i-ces,

many days fell away with nothing to show.
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love.
Gray clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above.

But if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

And if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices,

in your pose as the dust
settles around us.
And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love.
Gray clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above.

But if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

And if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Eh, eh oh, eh oh,
eh, eh oh, eh oh,
eh, eh oh, eh oh,
eh, eh oh, eh oh.

Oh, where do we begin,
the rubble or our sins?
Oh, where do we begin,

And if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about...

If you close eyes,
does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

Eh, eh oh, eh oh,
