A few stolen moments is all that we share.

You've got your family, and they need you there.
Though I try to resist being last on your list.
But no other man's gonna do.


So I'm saving all my love for you.

It's not very easy, livin' all alone.

My friends try and tell me, find a man of your own.
But each time I try, I just break down and cry.
'Cause I'd rather be home feelin' blue.

So I'm savin' all my love for you.

You used to tell me we'd run away together.
Love gives you the right to be free.
You said be patient, just wait a little longer.
But that's just an old fantasy.

I've got to get ready, just a few minuites more.

Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through the door.
For tonight is the night for feeling alright.
We'll be making love the whole night through.

So I'm saving all my love,
yes I'm saving all my love,

yes I'm saving all my love for you.

No other woman is gonna love you more.
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feelin' alright.
We'll be makin' love the whole night through.

So I'm saving all my love,
yeah I'm saving all my love,

yes I'm saving all my love for you!
For you!
