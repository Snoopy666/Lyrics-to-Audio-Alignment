Some people live for the fortune, some people live just for the fame.
Some people live for the power, some people live just to play the game.
Some people think that the physical things define what's within and,
I've been there before, but that life's a bore, so full of the superficial.

Some people want it all, but I don't want nothing at all if it ain't you baby, if I ain't got you baby.
Some people want diamond rings.
Some just want everything.
But everything means nothing if I ain't got you, yeah.

Some people search for a fountain that promises forever young.
Some people need three dozen roses, and that's the only way to prove you love them.
Hand me the world on a silver platter,
and what good would it be,
with no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me?

Some people want it all, but I don't want nothing at all if it ain't you baby, if I ain't got you baby.
Some people want diamond rings.
Some just want everything.
But everything means nothing if I ain't got you, you, you.

Some people want it all, but I don't want nothing at all if it ain't you baby, if I ain't got you baby.
Some people want diamond rings.
Some just want everything.
But everything means nothing if I ain't got you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah...
If I ain't got you with me baby...
Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing,
if I ain't got you with me, baby...
