I know I may be young, but...
I've got feelings too, 
and I need to do what I feel like doin'.
So let me go,
and just listen...
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always sayin' little girl, don't step into the club
Well, I'm just tryin' to find out why, 'cause dancin's what I love
Woah, woah-oh, oh
I know I may come off quiet, may come off shy
But I feel like talkin', feel like dancin' when I see this guy
What's practical, what's logical, what the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancin' there
I'm a slave 4 U
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave 4 U
I won't deny it, I'm not tryin' to hide it
Baby, don't you wanna dance up on me?
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance up on me
Leavin' behind my name and age
Like that, you like it?
Yeah, now watch me
Woah, woah-oh, oh
I really wanna dance tonight with you
I really wanna do what you want me to
I really wanna dance tonight with you
I really wanna do what you want me to
Baby, don't you wanna dance up on me?
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance up on me
Leavin' behind my name and age
Slave 4 U
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave 4 U
I won't deny it, I'm not tryin' to hide it
Woah, woah-oh, oh
Woah, woah-oh, oh
I'm a slave 4 U
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave 4 U
I won't deny it, I'm not tryin' to hide it
Like that
