I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but...
There's a voice inside my head, sayin' you'll never reach it
Every step I'm taking, every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

These struggles I'm facing, the chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but... no I'm not breaking
I may not know it, but these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep goin'
And I, I gotta be strong

Just keep pushin' on, 'cause...
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side

It's the climb
Yeah

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side

It's the climb
Yeeeah!
Keep on movin', keep climbin'
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb!
Keep the faith, keep your faith
Woooaaah!
