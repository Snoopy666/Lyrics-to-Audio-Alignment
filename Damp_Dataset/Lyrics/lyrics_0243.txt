Kiss me hard before you go,
summertime sadness.
I just wanted you to know
that, baby, you're the best.

I got my red dress on tonight, dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight.
I done my hair up real big, beauty queen style.
My high heels off, I'm feelin' alive.
Oh, my God,
I feel it in the air. Telephone wires above
are sizzlin' like a snare.
Honey, I'm on fire.
I feel it everywhere.
Nothin' scares me any more.

Kiss me hard before you go,
summertime sadness.
And I just wanted you to know
that, baby, you're the best, yeah.

I got that summertime, summertime sadness.
S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness.
Got that summertime, summertime sadness,
oh, oh, oh.

I'm feeling electric tonight,
cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout ninety-nine.
I've got my bad baby by my heavenly side.
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight.
Oh, my God,
I feel it in the air. Telephone wires above
are sizzlin' like a snare.
Honey, I'm on fire.
I feel it everywhere.
Nothin' scares me anymore.

Kiss me hard before you go,
summertime sadness.
I just wanted you to know
that, baby, you're the best, yeah!

I got that summertime, summertime sadness.
S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness.
Got that summertime, summertime sadness,
oh, oh, oh.

I think I'll miss you forever,
like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky.
Later's better than never.
Even if you're gone,
I'm gonna drive... Drive...

I got that summertime, summertime sadness.
S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness.
Got that summertime, summertime sadness,
oh, oh, oh.

Kiss me hard before you go,
summertime sadness.
I wanted you to know

that, baby, you're the best, yeah!
I got that summertime, summertime sadness.
S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness.
Got that summertime, summertime sadness,
oh, oh, oh.
