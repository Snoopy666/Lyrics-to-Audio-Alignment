Ooh, I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker and I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall.
So lay it down,
lay it down.
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes, let me hear you say you want it all.
Say it now,
say it now.
Look what you're doing,
look what you've done.
But in this jungle, you can't run,
'cause what I got for you,
I promise it's a killer,
you'll be banging on my chest.
Bang!
Bang!
Gorilla!
Ooh, yeah.
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas.
Ooh, yeah.
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas.
Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair, but you don't look like you're scared, you just smile and tell me,
"Daddy, it's yours."
'Cause you know how I like it, you's a dirty little lover.
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff, call the SWAT, we don't stop, we keep rocking while they're knocking on our door.
And you're screaming,
"Give it to me, baby, give it to me motherlover!"
Oh, look what you're doing,
look what you've done.
But in this jungle, you can't run,
'cause what I got for you,
I promise it's a killer,
you'll be banging on my chest.
Bang!
Bang!
Gorilla!
Ooh, yeah.
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas.
Ooh, yeah.
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas.
I bet you never, ever felt so good,
so good!
I got your body trembling like it should,
it should.
You'll never be the same, baby, once I'm done with
you!
You!
You!
Oh, you and me baby, making love like gorillas.
Ooh,
yeah.
You and me, baby, we'll be loving like gorillas!
Oh,
yeah,
oh,
baby, oh, yeah.
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas.
