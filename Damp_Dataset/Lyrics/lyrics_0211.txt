Look at me, you may think you see who I really am
but you'll never know me.
Every day it's as if I play a part.

Now I see, if I wear a mask I can fool the world,
but I cannot fool my heart...

Who is that girl I see
staring straight back at me?

When will my reflection show who I am inside?

I am now in a world where I have to hide my heart,
and what I believe in.

But somehow, I will show the world
what's inside my heart,
and be loved for who I am!

Who is that girl I see...
...staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?

Must I pretend that I'm someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show...

...who I am inside?
There's a heart that must be free to fly...
...that burns with a need to know the reason why!

Why must we all conceal what we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide?

I won't pretend that I'm someone else for all time...
When will my reflection show who I am inside?

When will my reflection show...
...who I am inside?
Oh yeah...
