'L' is for the way you look at me,
'O' is for the only one I see.

'V' is very, very extraordinary,
'E' is even more than anyone that you adore can
love... is all that I can give to you,
love is more than just a game for two.

Two in love can make it,
take my heart, but please don't break it,
love was made for me and you!



Yeah, 'L' is for the way you look,
you're lookin' at me.
And 'O' is for the only one I see.

'V' is so very, very extraordinary, now 'E' is e-even more than any, any, any one that you adore
can love... is all that I'm gonna give to you.
Oh, love is more than just a game for two,

two in love can make it take my heart, but please don't you break it,
'cause love was made for me and you!

I'm tellin' you that love was made for me and you!

Don't you know that love was made for me and you!
Whoo-eeeee!
