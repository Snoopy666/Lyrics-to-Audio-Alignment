And it's a hard pill for you to swallow.
But if I fall for you,
I'll never recover.

I'll never be the same.

I really wanna love somebody,

I really wanna dance the night away.
I know we're only halfway there, but you take me all the way.
You take me all the way.

I really wanna touch somebody.

I think about you every single day.
I know we're only halfway there, but you take me all the way.
You take me all the way.

You're such a hard act for me to follow.

Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow.
Yeah, but if I fall for you,
I'll never recover.
