Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
from glen to glen and down the mountain side.

The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying.
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
or when the valley's hushed and white with snow.

'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.

And if you come when all the flowers are dying,
and I am dead, as dead I well may be,

you'll come and find the place where I am lying
and kneel and say an ''Ave'' there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me.
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be.

If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me,
I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
