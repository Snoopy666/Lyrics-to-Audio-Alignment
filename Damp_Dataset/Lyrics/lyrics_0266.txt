Give me your, give me your, give me your attention, baby.
I gotta tell you a little somethin' about yourself.
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh you're a sexy lady,
but you walk around here like you wanna be someone else.
Oh woah oh oh!
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine.
Fine, so fine.
Oh woah oh oh!
Oh girl, I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine.
Mine, oh mine.

Treasure, that is what you are.
Honey, you're my golden star.
You know you could make my wish come true,
if you let me treasure you.

If you let me treasure you, oh oh!

Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl, you should be smiling.
A girl like that should never look so blue.
You're everything I see in my dreams.
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true.
Oh woah oh oh!
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine.
Fine, so fine.
Oh woah oh oh!
Oh girl, I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine.
Mine, oh mine.

Treasure, that is what you are.
Honey, you're my golden star.
You know you could make my wish come true,
if you let me treasure you.

If you let me treasure you, oh oh!
You are my treasure.
You are my treasure.
You are my treasure.
Yeah you, you, you, you are!
You are my treasure.
You are my treasure.
You are my treasure.
Yeah you, you, you, you are!

Treasure, that is what you are.
Honey, you're my golden star.
You know you could make my wish come true,
if you let me treasure you.

If you let me treasure you, oh oh!
