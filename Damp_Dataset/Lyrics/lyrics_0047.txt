I'll have a blue Christmas without you.
I'll be so blue just thinkin' about you.
Decorations are red on a green Christmas tree.
Won't seem the same, dear,
if you're not here with me.
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin',
That's when those blue memories start callin'.
You'll be doin' alright
with your Christmas of white,
but I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas.
You'll be doin' alright
with your Christmas of white,
but I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas.
