Summertime, and the living is easy.
Fish are jumpin',
and the cotton is high.
Oh, your daddy's rich, and your momma's good looking.
So hush, little baby, don't you cry.
One of these mornings, you're gonna rise up singing.
Then you'll spread your wings, and take to the sky.
But till that morning,
there's a-nothin' that can harm you.
With momma and papa standing by.
