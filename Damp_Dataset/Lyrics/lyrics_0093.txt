When your day is long
and the night,
the night is yours alone.

When you're sure you've had enough
of this life,
well, hang on.

Don't let yourself go,
'cause everybody cries.

And everybody hurts,

sometimes.
Sometimes everything is wrong.

Now it's time to sing along.
When your day is night alone,
hold on.
If you feel like letting go.

If you think you've had too much of this life,
well, hang on.

Because everybody hurts.
Take comfort in your friends.

Everybody hurts.

Don't throw your hand.
Oh, no.
Don't throw your hand.
If you feel like you're alone.
No, no, no, you're not alone.

If you're on your own
in this life,
the days and nights are long.

When you think you've had too much
of this life
to hang on.

Well, everybody hurts,
sometimes,
everybody cries.

Everybody hurts...

Sometimes.
Everybody hurts,
sometimes.
So hold on, hold on.
Hold on,
hold on.
Hold on,
hold on.
Hold on.
Everybody hurts.
Ooh...
Everybody hurts.
Ooh...
