Today I don't feel like doin' anything.
I just want to lay in my bed.
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone,
so leave a message at the tone.
'Cause today I swear I'm not doin' anything.

I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan,
turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants.
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't.
Nah, I'll be loungin' on my couch, just chillin' in my Snuggie.
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie.
'Cause in my castle, I'm the frickin' man.
Oh, yes, I said it,
I said it!
I said it 'cause I can.

Today I don't feel like doin' anything,
I just want to lay in my bed.
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone,
so leave a message at the tone.
'Cause today I swear I'm not doin' anything,
nothing at all!

Nothing at all!

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X,
meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex.
And she's gonna scream out, "This is great!"
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree.
I bet my old man would be so proud of me,
but sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait.
Oh, yes, I said it,
I said it!
I said it 'cause I can.

Today I don't feel like doin' anything.
I just want to lay in my bed.
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone,
So leave a message at the tone.
'Cause today I swear I'm not doin' anything.

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'cause I ain't goin' anywhere.
No no no no no no no no no!
I'll just strut in my birthday suit,
and let everything hang loose.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

Oh, today I don't feel like doin' anything,
I just wanna lay in my bed.
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone,
so leave a message at the tone.
'Cause today I swear I'm not doin' anything.
Nothing at all!

Nothing at all!
Nothing at all!
