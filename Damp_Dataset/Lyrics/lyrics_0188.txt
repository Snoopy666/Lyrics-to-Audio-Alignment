I got sunshine on a cloudy day.

When it's cold outside, I got the month of May.
I guess you'd say,
what can make me feel this way?

My girl.
Talkin' 'bout my girl.
My girl!

I got so much honey, the bees envy me.

I got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees.
Well, I guess you'd say,
what can make me feel this way?

My girl.
Talkin' 'bout my girl.
My girl!

Oooooh...
Hey hey hey.
Hey hey hey.
Ooooh, yeah.

I don't need no money, fortune or fame.

I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim.
Well, I guess you'd say,
what can make me feel this way?

My girl.
Talkin' 'bout my girl.
My girl!

I got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl.

I even got the month of May with my girl.
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl.
