Right now, he's probably slow dancin' with a bleach blond tramp and she's probably gettin' frisky
Right now, he's probably buyin' her some fruity little drink, 'cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool stick, showin' her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know...

That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires

Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now, she's probbably up singin' some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably sayin' I'm drunk
And he's thinkin' that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbin' all three dollars worth of that bathroom cologne
Oh and he don't know...

That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think

Before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oh oh...
