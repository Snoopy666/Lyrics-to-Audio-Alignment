Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know, and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do
So I cry, and I pray and I beg
Say that you love me
Go on and fool me
Pretend that you love me
Just say that you need me
So I cry
And I pray for you to
Say that you love me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you
Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go
So I cry, I pray and I beg
Say that you love me
Go on and fool me
Pretend that you love me
Just say that you need me
So I cry
And I pray for you to
Say that you love me
Just say that you need me
I don't care 'bout anything but you
Say that you love me
Go on and fool me
I know that you need me
I don't care bout anything but you
