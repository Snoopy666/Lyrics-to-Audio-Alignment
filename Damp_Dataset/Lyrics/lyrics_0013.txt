When I was young
I never needed anyone,
and making love was just for fun.
Those days are gone.

Living alone,
I think of all the friends I've known,
but when I dial the telephone,
nobody's home.

All by myself.
Don't wanna be, all by myself,
anymore.

All by myself.
Don't wanna live, all by myself,
anymore.

Hard to be sure,
sometimes I feel so insecure,
and love so distant and obscure
remains the cure.

All by myself.
Don't wanna be, all by myself,
anymore.

All by myself.
Don't wanna live, all by myself,
anymore.
