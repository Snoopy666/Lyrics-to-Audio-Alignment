If you ever leave me, baby,
leave some morphine at my door
'cause it would take a whole lot of medication
to realize what we used to have, we don't have it anymore.

There's no religion that can save me,
no matter how long my knees are on the floor.
Oh, so keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
to keep you by my side, and keep you from walkin' out the door.

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby.
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby.
And just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same,
if you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain!

Oooooooh!
Oooooooh!

I'll never be your mother's favorite.
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye.
Oooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing,
sayin' there goes my little girl, walkin' with that troublesome guy.

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand.
Oooh, but, little darling, watch me change their minds.
Yeah for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try.
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding if that'll make you mine.

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby.
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby.
And just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same,
if you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain!

Oooooooh!
Oooooooh!
Oh, don't you say goodbye.
Don't you say goodbye.
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding if that'll make it right.

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby.
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby.
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same, if you walk away
every day it'll rain, rain, rain!

Oooooooh.
Oooooooh...
