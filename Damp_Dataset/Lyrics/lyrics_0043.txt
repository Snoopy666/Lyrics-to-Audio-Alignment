Maybe it's the way she walked.
Oww!
Straight into my heart and stole it.
Through the doors and past the guards.
Oww!
Just like she already owned it.
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

And we danced all night
to the best song ever,
we knew every line,
now I can't remember
how it goes, but I know
that I won't forget her,
'cause we danced all night
to the best song ever.
I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh,"
I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,"
I think it goes..."Woo!"

Said her name was Georgia Rose.
Oww!
And her daddy was a dentist.
Said I had a dirty mouth,
I got a dirty mouth,
but she kissed me like she meant it.
I said, "Can I take you home with me."
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

And we danced all night
to the best song ever,
we knew every line,
now I can't remember
how it goes, but I know
that I won't forget her,
'cause we danced all night
to the best song ever.
I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh,"
I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,"
I think it goes..."Woo!"

You know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
and I know, you know, I know you'll remember me.
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you,
and I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced.
How we danced.
...Two, one, two, three.

And we danced.
We knew every line.
...How it goes, but I know
that I won't forget her,
'cause we danced, we danced.

It goes something like, "Yeah!"
...We knew every line,
now I can't remember
how it goes, but I know
that I won't forget her.
Best song ever, yeah!

Best song ever.
It was the best song ever.
It was the best song ever.
It was the best song ever.
