Like anyone would be,
I am flattered by your fascination with me.
Like any hot-blooded woman,
I have simply wanted an object to crave,
but you, you're not allowed.
You're uninvited,
an unfortunate slight.
Must be strangely exciting
to watch the stoic squirm.
Must be somewhat heartening
to watch shepherd need shepherd,
but you, you're not allowed.
You're uninvited,
an unfortunate slight.
Like any uncharted territory,
I must seem greatly intriguing.
You speak of my love like you have experienced love like mine before,
but this is not allowed.
You're uninvited,
an unfortunate slight.
I don't think you unworthy,
I need a moment to deliberate...
