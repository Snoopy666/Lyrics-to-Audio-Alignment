We've only just begun to live.
White lace and promises,
a kiss for luck and we're on our way.
Before the rising sun, we fly.
So many roads to choose,
we start out walking and learn to run.
Sharing horizons that are new to us,
watching the signs along the way.
Talking it over, just the two of us,
working together day to day,
together.
And when the evening comes, we smile.
So much of life ahead.
We'll find a place where there's room to grow.
Sharing horizons that are new to us,

Talking it over, just the two of us,
working together day to day,
together, together.
And when the evening comes, we smile.
So much of life ahead.
We'll find a place where there's room to grow.
And yes, we've just begun.
