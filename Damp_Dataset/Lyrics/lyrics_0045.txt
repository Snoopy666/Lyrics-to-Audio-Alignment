I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad,
buy all of the things I never had.
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes Magazine,
smilin' next to Oprah and the Queen.

Oh, every time I close my eyes,
I see my name in shining lights.
Yeah, a different city every night oh I, I swear,
the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire!

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah,
I would be the host of.
Every day Christmas, give Travie a wish list,
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt,
and adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit.
Give away a few Mercedes like, 'Here lady, have this'!
And last but not least, grant somebody they last wish.
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so,
you can call me Travie Claus, minus the Ho Ho.
Get it? I'd probably visit when Katrina hit,
and damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did.
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid, everywhere I go, Imma have my own theme music!

Every time I close my eyes,
I see my name in shining lights.
Oh yeah!
A different city every night oh I, I swear,

the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire!
When I'm a billionaire!
Let's go!

I'll be playin' basket ball with the president,
dunkin' on his delegates,
then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette.
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it,
but keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate.
Yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket,
we in recession, but let me take a crack at it.
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up,
so everybody that I love can have a couple bucks.
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was, eatin' good, sleepin' soundly.
I know we all have a similar dream,
go in your pocket, pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing!

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad,
buy all of the things I never had.
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes Magazine,
smilin' next to Oprah and the Queen.

Oh, every time I close my eyes,
I see my name in shining lights.
Oh yeah!
A different city every night oh I, I swear,

the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire!
When I'm a billionaire!

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad...
