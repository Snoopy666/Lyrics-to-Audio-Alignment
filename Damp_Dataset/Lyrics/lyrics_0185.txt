Ooh...

I'm broken,
do you hear me?
I'm blinded,
'cause you are everything I see.

I'm dancin',
alone,
I'm praying,
that your heart will just turn around.
And as I walk up to your door,
my head turns to face the floor,
'cause I can't look you in the eyes and say...

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
it just won't feel right,
'cause I can love you more than this,
yeah.

When he lays you down, I might just die inside,
it just don't feel right,
'cause I can love you more than this.
Can love you more than this.

If I'm louder,
would you see me?
Would you lay down,
in my arms and rescue me?

'Cause we are
the same,
you save me,
when you leave it's gone again.
And then I see you on the street,
in his arms, I get weak,
my body fails, I'm on my knees,
prayin'.

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
it just won't feel right,
'cause I can love you more than this,
yeah.

When he lays you down, I might just die inside,
it just don't feel right,
'cause I can love you more than this.
Yeah,

I've never had the words to say,
but now I'm askin' you to stay,
for a little while inside my arms.
And as you close your eyes tonight,
I pray that you will see the light,
that's shining from the stars above.
And I say...

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
it just won't feel right,
'cause I can love you more than this,
yeah.

When he lays you down, I might just die inside,
it just don't feel right,
'cause I can love you more than this,
yeah.

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight,
it just won't feel right,
'cause I can love you more than this,
yeah.

When he lays you down, I might just die inside,
it just don't feel right,
'cause I can love you more than this.
Can love you more than this.
