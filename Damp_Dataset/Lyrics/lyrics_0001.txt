He always needs people to stare at him,
she's always thinking that's not fair to them.
Well, he's found his new obsession:
giving off the wrong impression.

Looks in mirrors more than he looks at her,
he asks her what she thinks he should wear.
If he thinks that he'll be famous,
then he'll do it with or without her there.
Yeah, he'll do it with or without her there.

He's only in it for the spotlight,
he wants the headlines reading his name.
He'll do anything he thinks might

She goes out every night, on the town, don't know why,
trying to find her way out of this place.

give her fifteen seconds of fame.

He wants to be, she wants to be...
Famous is contagious but it's dangerous on relationships,
if they want to make it they should take a break and go it alone.
He wants to be, she wants to be...
Plastered on the covers and in front of all the others
but they look so good together that it's better if they fake their pleasure.

They're only in it for the spotlight,
they want the headlines reading their names.
And they'll do anything they think might

give them fifteen seconds of fame,

they want the headlines reading their names.
