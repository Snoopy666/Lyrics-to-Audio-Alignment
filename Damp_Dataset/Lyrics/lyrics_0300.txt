You've got a friend in me.
You've got a friend in me.
When the road looks rough ahead,
and you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed,
you just remember what your old pal said.
Boy, you've got a friend in me.

Yeah, you've got a friend in me.

You've got a friend in me.
You've got a friend in me.
You got troubles, and I've got 'em, too.
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you.
We stick together and see it through,
'cause you've got a friend in me.
You've got a friend in me.

Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am.
Bigger and stronger, too, maybe.
But none of them will ever love you the way I do.
It's me and you, boy.

And as the years go by,
our friendship will never die.
You're gonna see it's our destiny.
You've got a friend in me.
You've got a friend in me.
You've got a friend in me.
