Silent night, holy night;
all is calm, all is bright.
Round yon' virgin, mother and child,
Holy Infant so tender and mild.

Sleep in heavenly peace,
sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night, holy night;
shepherds quake at the sight.
Glories stream from heaven afar,
heav'nly hosts sing, "Alleluia!"

Christ, the Savior is born,
Christ, the Savior is born!

Silent night, holy night;
Son of God, love's pure light.
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
with the dawn of redeeming grace.

Jesus, Lord at thy birth,
Jesus, Lord at thy birth.
