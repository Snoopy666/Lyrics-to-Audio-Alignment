Yeah...

You are my fire, my one desire.
Believe when I say, I want it that way.

But we are two worlds apart,
can't reach to your heart,
when you say that I want it that way.

Tell me why, ain't nothin' but a heartache.
Tell me why, ain't nothin' but a mistake.
I never wanna hear you say,
I want it that way.

Am I your fire, your one desire?
Yes I know it's too late,
but I want it that way.

Tell me why, ain't nothin' but a heartache.
Tell me why, ain't nothin' but a mistake.
I never wanna hear you say,
I want it that way.

Now I can see that we're fallin' apart,
from the way that it used to be, yeah.
No matter the distance, I want you to know,
that deep down inside of me...

You are my fire,
the one desire.
You are...

Don't wanna hear you say!
Don't wanna hear you say...
Oh yeah.

Tell me why, ain't nothin' but a heartache.
Tell me why, ain't nothin' but a mistake.
I never wanna hear you say,
I want it that way.

Tell me whyyyyyy!
Don't wanna hear you say it!

'Cause I want it that way.
