Say something, I'm giving up on you.
I'll be the one if you want me to.

Anywhere, I would have followed you.
Say something, I'm giving up on you.

And I...
am feeling so small,
it was over my head,
I know nothing at all.

And I...
will stumble and fall.
I'm still learning to love,
just starting to crawl.

Say something, I'm giving up on you.
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.

Anywhere, I would have followed you.
Say something, I'm giving up on you.

And I...
will swallow my pride.
You're the one
that I love,
and I'm saying goodbye.

Say something, I'm giving up on you.
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.

And anywhere I would have followed you.
Oh, oh, oh...
Say something, I'm giving up on you.

Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Say something...
