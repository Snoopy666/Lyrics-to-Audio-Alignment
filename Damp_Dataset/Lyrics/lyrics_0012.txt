eah, yeah, yeah...
Since the day they got married, he'd been prayin' for a little baby boy.
Some one he could take fishing, throw the football and be his pride and joy.
He could already see him holding that trophy,
taking his team to state,
but when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
all those big dreams changed.
Now he's wrapped around her finger, she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl.
Sixteen short years later, she was fallin' for the senior football star.
Before he knew it, he was droppin' passes,
skippin' practice just to spend more time with her.
The coach said, hey son what's your problem?
Tell me have you lost your mind?
Daddy said you'll lose your free ride to college
boy, you better tell her goodbye, but...
Now he's wrapped around her finger, she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American...
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own.
She said be honest, tell me what you want,
and he said, honey you oughta know!
Sweet little, beautiful
one just like you,
oh, beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American...
Now he's wrapped around her finger, she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl!
All-American girl!
