We both lie silently still in the dead of the night.
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside.
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you,
though I tried,
but I guess that's why they say.
Every rose has its thorn.
Just like every night has its dawn.
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song.
Every rose has its thorn,
oh, yeah it does.
I listen to our favorite song
playing on the radio,
hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go.
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now,
if I could've let you know somehow.
I guess every rose has its thorn.
Just like every night has its dawn.
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song,
every rose has its thorn.
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain.
Like the knife that cuts you the wound heals
but the scar, that scar remains.
I know I could have saved a love that night
if I'd known what to say.
'Stead of makin' love
we both made our separate ways.
And now I hear you found somebody new
and that I never meant that much to you.
And to hear that tears me up inside
and to see you cuts me like a knife.
I guess every rose has its thorn.
Just like every night has it's dawn.
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song,
every rose has its thorn.
