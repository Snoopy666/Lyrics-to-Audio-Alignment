Baby, I'm so in to you
You got that somethin', what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oooh crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Oh, oh
Tell me you're so into me, 
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oooh crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night
You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oooh crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
You drive me crazy, baby, yeah, yeah
Ooooh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
