It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M.
Just put your paws up.
'Cause you were born this way, baby.
My momma told me when I was young
we're all born superstars.
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
in a glass of her boudoir.
There's nothing wrong with lovin' who you are
she said, "'cause He made you perfect, babe.
So hold your head up girl and you'll go far,
listen to me when I say..."
I'm beautiful in my way
'cause God makes no mistakes,
I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way.
Don't hide yourself in regret,
just love yourself and you're set,
I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way.
Ooh, there ain't no other way,
baby I was born this way,
baby I was born this way,
born this way.
There ain't no other way,
baby I was born this way.
Right track baby I was born this way.
Don't be a drag, just be a queen.
Don't be a drag, just be a queen.
Don't be a drag, just be a queen...
Give yourself prudence and love your friends;
subway kid, rejoice the truth.
And no religion of the insecure,
I must be myself, respect my youth.
A different lover is not a sin,
believe capital H-I-M.
Hey, hey, hey.
I love my life, I love this record and
mi amore vole fe yah.
I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes,
I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way.
Don't hide yourself in regret,
just love yourself and you're set,
I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way.
Ooh, there ain't no other way,

Don't be a drag, just be a queen,
whether your broke or evergreen.
You're black, white, beige, Chola, descent,
you're Lebanese, you're Orient.
Whether life's disabilaties
left you outcast, bullied, or teased,
rejoice and love yourself today,
