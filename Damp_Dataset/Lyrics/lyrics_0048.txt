Everybody get up.
Woo!
Hey hey hey.
Hey hey hey.
Uh.
Hey hey hey.
Woo!
If you can't hear what I'm tryin' to say.
If you can't read from the same page.
Maybe I'm goin' deaf,
maybe I'm goin' blind,
maybe I'm out of my mind.
Okay, now he was close, tried to domesticate you.
But you're an animal, baby it's in your nature.
Just let me liberate you,
you don't need no papers,
that man is not your maker.
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl.
I know you want it.
I know you want it.
I know you want it.
You're a good girl.
Can't let it get past me.
You're far from plastic.
Talk about gettin' blasted.
I hate these blurred lines.
I know you want it.
I know you want it.
I know you want it.
But you're a good girl.
The way you grab me,
must wanna get nasty.
Go 'head, get at me.
What do they make dreams for when you got them jeans on?
What do they make steam for?
You the hottest b**** in this place!
I feel so lucky,
you wanna hug me.
What rhymes with hug me?
Hey!

One thing I ask of you, let me be the one you back that a** to.
Go from Malibu to Paris, boo.
Yeah, I had a b****, but she ain't bad as you.
So hit me up when you passing through.
I'll give you something big enough to tear your **** in two.
Swag on, even when you dress casual.
I mean, it's almost unbearable.
In a hundred year not dare would I pull a Pharcyde, bitch you're passin' me by.
Nothin' like your last guy, he's too square for you.
He don't smack that a** and pull your hair like that.
So I just watch, and wait for you to salute the truely pimpin'.
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'.
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it confused, you gettin' it.
Shake your vibe, get down.
Get up.
Do it like it hurt.
Like it hurt.
What, you don't like work?
Hey!
Baby can you breathe?
I got this from Jamaica.
It always works for me, Dakota to Decatur.
No more pretending.
'Cause now you winning.
Here's our beginning.
I always wanted a good girl.
I know you want it.
I know you want it.

You're a good girl.
Can't let it get past me.
You're far from plastic.
Talk about gettin' blasted.
