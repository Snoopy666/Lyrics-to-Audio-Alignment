Ever wonder 'bout what he's doin?
How it all turned to lies.
Sometimes I think that it's better to never ask why.
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame.
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned.
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die.
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
Eh, eh.
Funny how the heart can be deceiving,
more than just a couple times.
Why do we fall in love so easy,
even when it's not right?
Oh oh, oh, oh oh...
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame.
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned.
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die.
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
Ever worry that it might be ruined?
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doin' what you're doin',
are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by,
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame.
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned.
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die.
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You've gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
Gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
You gotta get up and try, try, try!
Oh, oh oh.
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try.
Gotta get up, and try, try, try.
