Hey, ay, ay, yeah,
ah, ha, ha, yeah.

An old man turned ninety-eight,
he won the lottery and died the next day.

It's a black fly in your chardonnay,
it's a death row pardon two minutes too late.
And isn't it ironic,
don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day,
it's a free ride when you've already paid.

It's the good advice that you just didn't take,
and who would've thought, it figures?

Mr. Play-It-Safe,
was afraid to fly.
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye.

He waited his whole damn life,
to take that flight,
and as the plane crashed down he thought,
"Well isn't this nice?"
And isn't it ironic,
don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day,
it's a free ride when you've already paid.

It's the good advice that you just didn't take,
and who would've thought, it figures?

Well, life has a funny way
of sneakin' up on you when you think everything's okay,
and everything's goin' right.
And life has a funny way
of helpin' you out when you think everything's gone wrong,
and everything blows up in your face.

A traffic jam,
when you're already late,
a no-smoking sign on your cigarette break.

It's like ten thousand spoons,
when all you need is a knife,
it's meeting the man of my dreams,
and then meeting his beautiful wife.
Mmm, and isn't it ironic,
don't you think?
A little too ironic,
and yeah, I really do think.

It's like rain on your wedding day,
it's a free ride when you've already paid.
It's the good advice that you just didn't take,

and who would've thought, it figures?
And yeah, life has a funny way
of sneakin' up on you.
And life has a funny, funny way,
of helping you out,
helpin' you out.
