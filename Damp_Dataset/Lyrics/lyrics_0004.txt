Makin' my way downtown, walkin' fast,
faces pass and I'm home bound.
Staring blankly ahead, just makin' a way,
makin' a way through the crowd.
And I need you,
and I miss you,
and now I wonder...

If I could fall into the sky,
do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you tonight.


It's always times like these when I think of you,
and I wonder if you ever think of me.
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong,
livin' in your precious memories.
'Cause I need you,
and I miss you,
and now I wonder...

If I could fall into the sky,
do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you tonight.

And I, I don't want to let you know.
I, I drown in your memory.
I, I don't want to let this go.
I, I don't...

Makin' my way downtown, walkin' fast,
faces pass and I'm home bound.
Staring blankly ahead, just makin' a way,
makin' a way through the crowd.
And I still need you,
and I still miss you,
and now I wonder...

If I could fall into the sky,
do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you...
