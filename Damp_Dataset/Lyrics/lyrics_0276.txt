Feeling my way through the darkness,
guided by a beating heart.

I can't tell where the journey will end,
but I know where to start.

They tell me I'm too young to understand.
They say I'm caught up in a dream.

Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes...
Well that's fine by me.

So wake me up when it's all over.
When I'm wiser and I'm older.

All this time I was finding myself, and I didn't know I was lost.

So wake me up when it's all over.
When I'm wiser and I'm older.

All this time I was finding myself and I didn't know I was lost.


I tried carrying the weight of the world,
but I only have two hands.

I hope I get a chance to travel the world,
but I don't have any plans.

I wish that I could stay forever this young.
Not affraid to close my eyes.

Life's a game made for everyone,
and love is the prize.

So wake me up when it's all over.
When I'm wiser and I'm older.

All this time I was finding myself, and I didn't know I was lost.

So wake me up when it's all over.
When I'm wiser and I'm older.

All this time I was finding myself and I... I didn't know I was lost.

I didn't know I was lost.
I didn't know I was lost.
I didn't know I was lost.
I didn't know...
