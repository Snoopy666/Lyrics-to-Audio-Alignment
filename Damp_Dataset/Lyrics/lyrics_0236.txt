You say I only hear what I want to.
You say I talk so all the time, so...
And I thought what I felt was simple, and I thought that I don't belong.
But now that I'm leavin', now I know that I did something wrong, 'cause I missed you.
Yeah, I missed you.
You say I only hear what I want to.
I don't listen hard, don't pay attention to the distance that you're runnin' to anyone, anywhere.
I don't understand if you really care, I'm only hearin' negative, no no no.
So I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up, and this woman was singin' my song.
Lover's in love, and the other's run away.
Lover is cryin' 'cause the other won't stay.
Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was dyin' since the day they were born, well.
Well, this is not that, think that I'm throwin', but I'm thrown.
And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure.
You try to tell me that I'm clever, but that won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you.
And you said that I was naive and I thought that I was strong, oh.
I thought, hey I can leave, I can leave.
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you.
Yeah, I missed you.
You said you called me 'cause you want me.
One day you let me go, you try to give away a keeper.
Or keep me 'cause you know you're just so scared to lose.
And you say... stay.
You say I only hear what I want to.
