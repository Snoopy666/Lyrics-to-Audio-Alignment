Well sometimes, I go out by myself,
and I look across the water.
And I think of all the things,
what you're doin',
and in my head I paint a picture.
Since I've come on home,
well, my body's been a mess,
and I've missed your ginger hair,
and the way you like to dress.
Well, won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me.

Ah, why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie.

Did you have to go to jail,
put your house on up for sale,
did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didin't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya'.

Now are you shopping anywhere,
changed the color of your hair,
are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine,
that you were dodging all the time,
are you still dizzy?
Since I've come on home,
well my body's been a mess,
and I've missed your ginger hair,
and the way you like to dress.
Well, won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me.

Oh, why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie.

Oh, why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie.

Woah, Valerie.
Woah, Valerie.
Oh, Valerie.
Valerie, yeah, Valerie.
Oh, why don't you come on over Valerie?
