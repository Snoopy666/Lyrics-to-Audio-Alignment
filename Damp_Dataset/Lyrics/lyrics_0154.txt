Lyin' here with you so close to me,
it's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe.
I'm caught up in this moment,
caught up in your smile...

I've never opened up to anyone.
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms.
We don't need to rush this,
let's just take it slow.

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight!
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright!
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up.
No, I don't wanna push too far.
Just a shot in the dark that you just might be the one I've be waiting for my whole life.

So, baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight.

I know that if we give this a little time,
it'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find.
It's never felt so real,
no, it's never felt
so right!

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight!
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright!
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up.
I don't wanna push too far.
Just a shot in the dark that you just might be the one I've be waiting for my whole life.

So, baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight.
No, I don't want to say goodnight!
I know it's time to leave,
but you'll be in my dreams...
tonight...
tonight...

tonight!
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight!
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright!
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up.
I don't wanna push too far.
Just a shot in the dark that you just might be the one I've be waiting for my whole life.
So, baby, I'm alright...
Oh, oh, oh!
Let's do this right

with just a kiss goodnight.
...with a kiss goodnight.
...kiss goodnight.
