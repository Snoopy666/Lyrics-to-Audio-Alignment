So lately, been wonderin', who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love, to light the shadows on your face.
If a greater wave shall fall, and fall upon us all,
then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own?


If I could, then I would, I'll go wherever you will go.
Way up high, or down low.

I'll go wherever you will go.

And maybe I'll find out a way to make it back some day.
To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days.
If a greater wave shall fall, and fall upon us all,

then I hope there is someone out there who can bring me back to you.

If I could, then I would, I'll go wherever you will go.

Way up high, or down low, I'll go wherever you will go.
Run away with my heart.
Run away with my hope.
Run away with my love.

I know now, just quite how,

my life and love might still go on.
In your heart, in your mind,

I'll stay with you for all of time.

If I could, then I would, I'll go wherever you will go.

Way up high, or down low, I'll go wherever you will go.
If I could turn back time,
I'll go wherever you will go.
If I could make you mine,
I'll go wherever you will go.
I'll go wherever you will go.
