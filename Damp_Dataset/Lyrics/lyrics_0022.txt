Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
that saved a wretch like me.

I once was lost, but now am found.
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear,
and Grace, my fear relieved.

How precious did that Grace appear,
the hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
we have already come.

T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far,
and Grace will lead us home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures.

He will shield and portion be,
as long as life endures.

I once was lost, but now am found.

Was blind, but now I see.
Oooooh...
