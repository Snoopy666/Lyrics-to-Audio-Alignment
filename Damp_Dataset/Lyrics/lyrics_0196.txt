If I should die before I wake,
it's 'cause you took my breath away.
Losing you is like livin' in a world with no air,
oh...

I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave,
my heart won't move, it's incomplete.
Is there another way that I could make you understand?
But how do you expect me, to live alone, with just me?

'Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe.
Tell me how I'm s'posed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air.
That's how I feel when I know you ain't there,

there's no air, no air.
Got me out here in the water so deep,
tell me how you gonna be without me?
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe,

there's no air, no air.
Oh oh, no air...

Oh, I... I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew,
right off the ground, to float to you.
There's no gravity to hold me down for real.

But somehow I'm still alive inside,
you took my breath, but I survived.
I don't know how, but I don't even care.
So how do you expect me, to live alone, with just me?

'Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe.
Tell me how I'm s'posed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air.
That's how I feel when I know you ain't there,

there's no air, no air.
Got me out here in the water so deep,
tell me how you gonna be without me?
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe,

there's no air, no air.
Oh, oh.
No, oh oh.
No more.
Oh!
Baby, no.
No air, no air.
Oh oh oh oh.

Tell me how I'm s'posed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air.

That's how I feel when I know you ain't there, there's no air, no air.
Got me out here in the water so deep,
tell me how you gonna be without me?
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe, there's no air, no air.

Baby, oh, oh oh.
Oh, I...

Tell me how I'm s'posed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air.
That's how I feel when I know you ain't there, there's no air, no air.
Got me out here in the water so deep,
tell me how you gonna be without me?
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe, there's no air, no air.
