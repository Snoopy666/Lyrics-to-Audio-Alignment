Hoo, ooh, ooh ooh.
Yeah.
I can read your mind, and I know your story.
I see what you're goin' through, yeah.
It's an uphill climb, and I'm feeling sorry,
but I know it will come to you, yeah.
So don't surrender, 'cause you can't win
in this thing called love.
When you want it the most, there's no easy way out.
When you're ready to go, and your heart's left in doubt, don't give up on your faith.
Love comes to those who believe it, and that's the way it is.
When you question me, for a simple answer,
I don't know what to say, no.
But it's plain to see, if you stick together,
you're gonna find a way, yeah.
So don't surrender, 'cause-a you can't win
in this thing called love.
When you want it the most, there's no easy way out.
When you're ready to go, and your heart's left in doubt, don't give up on your faith.
Love comes to those who believe it, and that's the way it is.
That's the way it is.
When life is empty, with no tomorrow,
and liness starts to call.
Baby don't worry, forget your sorrow,
'cause love's gonna conquer it all.
Oh!
When you want it the most, there's no easy way out.
When you're ready to go, and your heart's left in doubt, don't give up on your faith.
Love comes to those who believe, it.
Oh, oh, oh!

And your heart.
