I've heard there was a secret chord
that David played, and it pleased the Lord
but you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth,
the minor fall, the major lift,

the baffled king composing Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof.
You saw her bathing on the roof.
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.
She tied you to a kitchen chair,
she broke your throne, she cut your hair,

and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Maybe I have been here before;
I know this room, I've walked this floor.
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
love is not a victory march,

it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

There was a time when you'd let me know
what's really going on below,
but now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you?
The holy dove was moving too,

and every breath we drew was Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Maybe there's a God above,
and all I ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.
And it's not a cry you can hear at night,
it's not somebody who's seen the light;

it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
