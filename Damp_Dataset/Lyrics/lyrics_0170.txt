Mmmmmm...
Mmm mmmm...
Mmmmmm...
Mmm Mmm.
If you, if you could return,
don't let it burn, don't let it fade.
I'm sure I'm not being rude, but it's just your attitude,
it's tearin' me apart, it's ruining everything.
I swore, swore I would be true,
and honey, so did you.
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lyin' all the time?
Was it just a game to you?
But I'm in so deep,
you know I'm such a fool for you.
You've got me wrapped around your finger, oh oh oh.
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
Oh, I thought the world of you.
I thought nothing could go wrong,
but I was wrong, I was wrong.
If you, if you could get by tryin' not to lie...
Things wouldn't be so confused, and I wouldn't feel so used.
But you always really knew, I just wanna be with you.
But I'm in so deep,
you know I'm such a fool for you.
You've got me wrapped around your finger, oh oh oh.
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
But I'm in so deep,
you know I'm such a fool for you.
You've got me wrapped around your finger, oh oh oh.
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
You know I'm such a fool for you.
You've got me wrapped around your finger, oh oh oh.
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
