I'm still alive but I'm barely breathin',
just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in.
'Cause I got time when she got freedom,
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even.

Her best days will be some of my worst,
she finally met a man that's gonna put her first.
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping,
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no!
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?

And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're O.K.? Yeah.
I'm falling to pieces! Yeah.

I'm falling to pieces!

They say bad things happen for a reason,
but no wise word's gonna stop the bleeding.
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving,
and when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even!
No!
What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you?

And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're O.K.? Yeah.
I'm falling to pieces!

I'm falling to pieces!
I'm falling to pieces!

I'm falling to pieces!
Oh, you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain,
you took your suitcase I took the blame.
Now I'm trying to make sense of what little remains, oh,
'cause you left me with no love, with no love to my name!

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathin',
just praying to a god that I don't believe in.
'Cause I got time while she got freedom,
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even!
What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you?

And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're O.K.? Yeah.
I'm falling to pieces!
I'm falling to pieces!

I'm falling to pieces!
I'm falling to pieces!


Oh, it don't break even, no, oh!
It don't break even, no, oh!
It don't break even, no...
