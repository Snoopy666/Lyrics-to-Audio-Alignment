Broken pieces of your life are on the floor.
You realize that you never needed help before.
Just take a risk, and take my hand.
You're new to this, I understand.
I promise if you let me in...

We can fly-y-y away.
Leave this behind, yeah you and I.

To a hi-i-hideaway, away.

Don't hi-i-hide your pain.
Please open up, give me your trust.

We can fly-y-y away, away!

You can't find love in an empty room.
Barricaded walls and doors won't hide your wounds.
Love, you should know, I'm right outside.
And if you open up you might...
let yourself go and touch the sky and...

We can fly-y-y away.
Leave this behind, yeah you and I.

To a hi-i-hideaway, away.

Don't hi-i-hide your pain.
Please open up, give me your trust.

We can fly-y-y away, away!

But if you decide to come back down...
Afraid of heights, say it's over now.
Ooh.
Then we'll hit the ground running, 'cause you're my only one and...
We can fix your broken wing, get you back in the clouds.

And fly-y-y away.
Leave this behind, yeah you and I.

To a hi-i-hideaway, away.

Hi-i-hide your pain.
Don't hide!
Give me your trust.

We can fly-y-y away, away!

We can fly away.
Yeah, you and I.

Leave this behind, away.

Don't, don't hide your pain!

Yeah, we can fly away.

Fly.
Away.
Hoo...
