Here we go again, I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me, I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again, we're sick like animals, we play pretend
You're just a cannibal and I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh, what are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Here we are again, I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin' heavy and I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time, you're killing me now!
And I won't be denied by you, the animal inside of you
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh, what are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Hush hush, the world is quiet,
hush hush, we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess, why can't you understand?
Oh I won't sleep toniiight!
I won't sleep toniiight!
Here we go again,
here we go again,
here we go again
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh, what are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting...
Oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh...
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
