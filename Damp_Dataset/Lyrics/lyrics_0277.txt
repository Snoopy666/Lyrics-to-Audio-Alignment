Uh!
Mmm, yeah.
La la la la la laaah...
Uh!

Hey, boy you never had much game,
so I needed to upgrade.
So I went and walked away, way, way
Uh!

Now I see you been hangin' out with that other girl in town.
Lookin' like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns.
Uh!
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doin' them with her.
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this, uh!
And now you're takin' her to every restaurant,
and everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're takin' her to every restaurant,
you got me, got me like this, uh!

Boy you can say anything you wanna,
I don't give a shhh, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back
I want you, want you back, uh!
I broke it off thinkin' you'd be cryin',
now I feel like shhh lookin' at you flyin'
I want you back, I want you back,
I want you, want you back, uh!

Please, this ain't even jealousy,
she ain't got a thing on me,
tryin' to rock them ugly jeans, jeans, jeans, uh!

You clearly didn't think this through,
if what I've been told is true,
you'll be crawlin' back like boo hoo hoo, uh!
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doin' them with her.
