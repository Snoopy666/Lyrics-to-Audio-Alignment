As long as you love me

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands

People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Riskin' it all in a glance

And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me

Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Mmm mm-hmm, doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

Who you are
Where you're from

I don't know who you are
Where you're from

Yeah
I tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
As long as you love me, baby

Who you are
Where you're from

As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from

As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
What you did

As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from

I don't care
