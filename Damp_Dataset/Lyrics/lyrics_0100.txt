She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart.
While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar.

And we don't know how,
how we got into this bad situation.
Only doin' things out of frustration.
Tryin' to make it work but man these times are hard.

She needs me now, but I can't seem to find the time.
I've got a new job now on the unemployment line.

And we don't know how, how we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us, 'cause we're doin' our best.
Tryin' to make it work, but man these times are hard.
But we're gonna start by
drinking old cheap bottles of wine, sit talking up all night.
Sayin' things we haven't for a while,
a while, yeah.
We're smiling but we're close to tears,
even after all these years.

We just now got the feelin' that we're meetin', for the first time.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh.

She's in line at the dole with her head held high.
Well I just lost my job, but didn't lose my pride.

And we both know how, how we're gonna make it work when it hurts, when you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt.
Tryin' to make it work, but man these times are hard.
But we're gonna start by,
drinking old cheap bottles of wine, sit talking up all night.
Doing things we haven't for a while,
a while, yeah.
We're smiling, but we're close to tears.

Even after all these years, we just now got the feelin' that we're meetin', for the first time.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

For the first time.
Oh, for the first time.
