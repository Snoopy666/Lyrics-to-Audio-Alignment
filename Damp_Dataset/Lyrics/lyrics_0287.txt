I close my eyes,
and I lift my hands.
I'm caught up in Your sweet melody,
I'm caught up in the dance.
And I hear Your song,
oh the sweet symphony.
And I realize the sacrifice is not one thing,
it's all of me.
This is my prayer, this is my plea.
Make me a worshipper to fall at Your throne.
Let my fire be so contagious it causes the world to join in Your song.
Make me a worshipper to fall at Your feet.
That I may live by more of You, and less of me.
Make me a worshipper.
Oh oh oh oh...
To be still and know You're speaking to me.
To know I've been called to so many greater things.
To expand Your kingdom, to make Your love known.
Oh, to cause the Earth to shake and worship You alone.
This is my prayer, this is my plea.
Make me a worshipper, to fall at Your throne.
Let my fire be so contagious it causes the world to join in Your song.
Make me a worshipper to fall at Your feet.
That I may live by more of You, and less of me.
Make me a worshipper.
Ooooh...
Oh, I wanna worship You, Lord.
Make me a worshipper.
