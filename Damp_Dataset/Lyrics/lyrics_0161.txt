First, we gotta create...
the mooood...
Percussion.
Strings.
Winds.
Words...

There you see her,
sitting there across the way.
She don't got a lot to say,
but there's something about her.
And you don't know why,
but you're dyin' to try,
you wanna kiss the girl!

Yes, you want her.
Look at her, you know you do.
Possible she wants you too,
there is one way to ask her.
It don't take a word,
not a single word,
go on and kiss the girl!
Sing with me now...

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh, my!
Look like the boy too shy,
he ain't gonna kiss the girl.

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad?
Ain't it a shame?
Too bad he gonna miss the girl.


Now's your moment,
floating in a blue lagoon.
Boy, you better do it soon,
no time will be better.
She don't say a word,
and she won't say a word
until ya kiss the girl!

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't be scared,
you got the mood prepared.
Go on and kiss the girl!

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't stop now.
Don't try to hide it how
you wanna kiss the girl!

Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Float along
and listen to this song,
the song say, 'kiss the girl!'

Sha-la-la-la-la
the music play.
Do what the music say!
Go on and kiss the girl!

Kiss the girl!
You wanna kiss the girl!
You've gotta kiss the girl!
Go on and kiss the girl!
