You packed in the morning and I
stared out the window, and I
struggled for something to say.
You left in the rain without closing the door,
I didn't stand in your way.
But I miss you more than I
missed you before, and now where I'll find comfort,
God knows.
'Cause you left me,
just when I needed you most.
Left me,
just when I needed you most.
Now most every morning I
stare out the window, and I
think about where you might be.
I've written you letters that I'd like to send,
if you would just send one to me.
'Cause I love you more than I
loved you before, and now
where I'll find comfort,
Godknows.
'Cause you left me,
just when I needed you most.
Left me,
just when I needed you most.

Oh yeah, you left me,
just when I needed you most.
You left me,
just when I needed you most.
