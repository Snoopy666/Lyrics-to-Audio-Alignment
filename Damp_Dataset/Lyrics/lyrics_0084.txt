Said the night wind to the little lamb,

do you see what I see?

Way up in the sky, little lamb,

do you see what I see?

A star, a star, dancing in the night,
with a tail as big as a kite.
With a tail as big as a kite.

Said the little lamb to the shepard boy,

do you hear what I hear?

Ringing through the sky, shepard boy,

do you hear what I hear?

A song, a song, high above the trees,
with a voice as big as the sea.
With a voice as big as the sea.

Said the shepard boy to the mighty king,

do you know what I know?

In your palace warm, mighty king,

do you know what I know?

A child, a child, shivers in the cold,
let us bring him silver and gold.
Let us bring him silver and gold.




Said the king to the people everywhere,

listen to what I say.

Pray for peace, people everywhere,

listen to what I say.

The child, the child, sleeping in the night,
he will bring us goodness and light.
He will bring us goodness and light.
He will bring us goodness and light.
