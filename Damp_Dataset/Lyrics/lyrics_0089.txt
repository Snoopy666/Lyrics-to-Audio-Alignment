Day after day, I'm more confused.
I look for the light through the pourin' rain.
You know that's a game that I hate to lose.
I'm feelin' the strain,
ain't it a shame?
Gimme the beat, boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away.
Gimme the beat, boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away.
Beginnin' to think I'm wastin' time.
Don't understand the things I do.
The world outside looks so unkind.
I'm countin' on you to carry me through!
Gimme the beat, boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away.
Gimme the beat, boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away.
When my mind is free,
you know a melody can move me.
And when I'm feelin' blue,
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me.
Thanks for the joy that you've given me.
I want you to know I believe in your song.
Rhythm and rhryme and harmony.
You helped me along,
you're makin' me strong!
Gimme the beat, boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away.
Gimme the beat, boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away
Oh oh oh, oh...
Gimme the beat, boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away.
Oh yeah!
Gimme the beat, boys and free my soul,
I wanna get lost in your rock n' roll and drift away.
Now now now, won't you, won't you take me!
Oh oh, take me...
