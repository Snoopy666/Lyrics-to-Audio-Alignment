It's been a long time since I came around,
been a long time, but I'm back in town.
This time I'm not leavin' without you.
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh,
I'll give anything again to be your baby doll.
This time I'm not leavin' without you.
He said, sit back down where you belong:
in the corner of my bar with your high heels on.
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time and you said to me...
Somethin', somethin' about this place.
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face.
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy.
Yeah, somethin' about, baby, you and I.
It's been two years since I let you go,
couldn't listen to a joke, or rock 'n' roll.
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart.
On my birthday you sang me "A Heart of Gold,"
with your guitar hummin' and no clothes.
This time I'm not leavin' without you,
oh oh oh, oh oh oh.
Sit back down where you belong:
in the corner of my bar with your high heels on.
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time and you said to me...
Somethin', somethin' about this place.
Somethin' 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face.
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy.
Yeah, somethin' about, baby, you and I.
You and I,
you, you and I,
you, you and I,
you, you and I.
You and I,
you, you and I,
oh yeah, I'd rather die,
without you and I.
Come on!
Put your drinks up!
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'cause you can't buy a house in heaven.
There's only three men that I'mma serve in my whole life:
it's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ.
Somethin' somethin' about the chase.
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down,
so have my lipstick all over your face.
Somethin', somethin' about just knowin' when it's right.
So put your drinks up for Nebraska,
for Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you!
You and I,
you, you and I,
baby, I'd rather die
without you and I.
You and I,
you, you and I,
Nebraska, I'd rather die
without you and I.
It's been a long time since I came around,
it's been a long time, but I'm back in town.
This time I'm not leavin' without you...
