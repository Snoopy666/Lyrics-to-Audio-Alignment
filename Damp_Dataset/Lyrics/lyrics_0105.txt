Made a wrong turn once or twice,
dug my way out, blood and fire.
Bad decisions, that's alright,
welcome to my silly life.
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood,
Miss "No way, it's all good,"
it didn't slow me down.
Mistaken, always second guessing,
underestimated, look, I'm still around.

Pretty, pretty please,
don't you ever, ever feel
like you're less than perfect.

Pretty, pretty please,
if you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing perfect to me.


You're so mean when you talk
about yourself, you were wrong.
Change the voices in your head,
make them like you instead.
So complicated, look how we all make it,
filled with so much hatred, such a tired game.
It's enough, I've done all I could think of,
chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same,
oh, oh!

Pretty, pretty please,
don't you ever, ever feel
like you're less than perfect.

Pretty, pretty please,
if you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing perfect to me.

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear,
the only thing I should be drinking is an
ice-cold beer.
So cool in lying and we try, try, try,
but we try too hard and it's a waste of my time.
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere,
they don't like my jeans, they don't
get my hair.
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time.
Why do we do that,
why do I do that?
Why do I do that?

Yeah!
Oh, oh, pretty, pretty, pretty...

Pretty, pretty please,
don't you ever, ever feel
like you're less than perfect.

Pretty, pretty please,
if you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing perfect

to me.
You're perfect,

you're perfect, oh.
... if you ever, ever feel
like you're nothing perfect to me.
