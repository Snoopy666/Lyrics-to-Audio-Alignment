Will you count me in?

I've been awake for a while, now.
You've got me feelin' like a child, now.

'Cause every time I see your bubbly face,
I get the tingles in a silly place.

It starts in my toes, and I crinkle my nose.
Wherever it goes, I always know

that you make me smile, please stay for a while, now.
Just take your time, wherever you go.

The rain is fallin' on my window pane,
but we are hidin' in a safer place.

Under covers, stayin' dry and warm,
you give me feelin's that I adore.

They start in my toes, and I crinkle my nose.
Wherever it goes, I always know

that you make me smile, please stay for a while, now.
Just take your time, wherever you go.

What am I gonna say?
When you make me feel this way, I just, mmm...

And it starts in my toes, and I crinkle my nose.
Wherever it goes, I always know

that you make me smile, please stay for a while, now.
Just take your time, wherever you go.

Dum-do-do-do-you-do-do-do-you-do, woo-do-you-do-do-do.

Bum-buh-dum-you-do-you-doo-do-do-you-do-do-do, mmm-hmm.

I've been asleep for a while now.
You tucked me in just like a child, now.

'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth.

It starts in my soul, and I lose all control
when you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows.

'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now, holdin' me tight.

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go.
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go.
