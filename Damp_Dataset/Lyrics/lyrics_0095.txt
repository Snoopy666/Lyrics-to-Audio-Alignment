Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body.
I know not everybody has got a body like you.
Oh, but I gotta think twice before I give my heart away.
And I know all the games you play, because I play them, too.
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion.
Time to pick my heart up off the floor.
And when that love comes down without devotion,
well it takes a strong man, baby, but I'm showin' you the door.
'Cause I gotta have faith.
I gotta have faith.
'Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith.
I gotta have faith, faith, faith!
Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay,
sayin' please, please, please don't go away, you say I'm givin' you the blues.
Maybe you mean every word you say.
Can't help but think of yesterday, and another who tied me down to loverboy rules.
Before this river becomes an ocean,
before you throw my heart back on the floor.
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion,
Well I need someone to hold me, but I'll wait for somethin' more.
Yes, I've gotta have faith.
Mmm, I've gotta have faith.
'Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith.
I gotta have faith, faith, faith!
Guess I'll have to wait, 'cause I gotta have faith.
I gotta have faith.
Before this river becomes an ocean,
before you throw my heart back on the floor.
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion,
Well I need someone to hold me, but I'll wait for somethin' more.
'Cause I've gotta have faith.
Mmm, I've gotta have faith.
'Cause I gotta have faith, faith, faith.
I gotta have faith, faith, faith!
