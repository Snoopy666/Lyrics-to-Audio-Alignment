I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please.
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby stay with me,
I love it.

Luck and intuition, play the cards with spades to start,
and after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
I'll get him hot, show him what I got.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
I'll get him hot, show him what I got.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

P-p-p-poker face,
p-p-poker face.
P-p-p-poker face,

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be.
A little gambling is fun when you're with me.

Russian roulette is not the same without a gun,
and baby, when it's love, if it ain't rough it isn't fun, fun.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
I'll get him hot, show him what I got.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
I'll get him hot, show him what I got.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

P-p-p-poker face,
p-p-poker face.
P-p-p-poker face,
p-p-poker face.
I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you, 'cause I'm bluffin with my muffin
I'm not lyin' I'm just stunnin' with my love glue-gunnin'.
Just like a chick in the casino, take your bank before I pay you out.

I promise this, promise this, check this hand, 'cause I'm marvelous.
Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.

P-p-p-poker face,
p-p-poker face.
