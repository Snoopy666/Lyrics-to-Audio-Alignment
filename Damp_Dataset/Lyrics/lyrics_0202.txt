Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

I think I did it again,
I made you believe we're more than just friends.

Oh baby, it might seem like a crush,
but that doesn't mean that I'm serious.
'Cause to lose all my senses,
that is just so typically me!
Ooh baby, baby!

Oops!... I did it again,
I played with your heart,
got lost in the game.
Ooh baby, baby!

Oops!... You think I'm in love,
that I'm sent from above.
I'm not that innocent!

You see, my problem is this,
I'm dreamin' away,
wishin' that heroes, they truly exist.

I cry watching the days.
Can't you see I'm a fool,
in so many ways?
But to lose all my senses,
that is just so typically me!
Baby, oh!

Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart,
got lost in the game.
Ooh baby, baby!

Oops!... You think I'm in love,
that I'm sent from above.
I'm not that innocent!

Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Oh, it's beautiful,
but wait a minute, isn't this...?
But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean at the end?
Aww, you shouldn't have!
Oops!... I did it again to your heart,
got lost in this game, oh, baby!
Oops!...You think that I'm sent from above.

I'm not that innocent!
I played with your heart.
Got lost in the game...
Ooh, baby, baby.

Oops!... You think I'm in love,
that I'm sent from above, oh, yeah!

Not that innocent, yeah,
did it again,
I played with your heart,
got lost in the game.
Ooh baby, baby.

Oops!... You think I'm in love,
that I'm sent from above.
I'm not that
innocent!
