Oh, baby, baby...
Oh, baby, baby...

Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
that somethin' wasn't right, yeah?

Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go,
and now you're out of sight, yeah.
Show me how you want it to be,
tell me baby, 'cause I need to know now, what we've got.

My loneliness is killin' me, and I...
I must confess I still believe, still believe.
When I'm not with you I lose my mind,
give me a sign.
Hit me, baby, one more time!

Oh, baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you.
Boy, you got me blinded.

I'll bet you, baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do,
that's not the way I planned it.
Show me
how you want it to be.
Tell me baby,
'cause I need to know now, what we've got.

My loneliness is killin' me, and I...
I must confess I still believe, still believe.
When I'm not with you I lose my mind,
give me a sign.
Hit me, baby, one more time!

Uh.
Yeah, yeah!
Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go.
I must confess
that my loneliness
is killing me now.
Don't you know I still believe
that you will be here
and give me a sign?
Hit me, baby, one more time!
