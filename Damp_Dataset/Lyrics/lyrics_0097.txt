Baby, when I think about you,
I think about love.
Darlin', I don't live without you,
and your love.
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterdays.
I would wrap you in the heavens 'til I'm dyin' on the way.
Feel like makin'...
I feel like makin' love.
I feel like makin' love.
I feel like makin' love.
Feel like makin' love to you.
Baby, if I think about you,
I think about love.
Darlin', if I live without you,
I live without love.
And if I had the sun and moon, they would shine in.
I would give you both night and day of satisfyin'.
Feel like makin'...
I feel like makin' love.
I feel like makin' love.
I feel like makin' love.
Feel like makin' love to you.
And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterdays.
I would wrap you in the heavens 'til I'm dyin' on the way.
Feel like makin'...
I feel like makin' love.
I feel like makin' love.
I feel like makin' love.
Feel like makin' love to you.
Well I feel like makin' love.
Well I feel like makin' love.
Well I feel like makin' love.
Feel like makin' love to you!
Well I feel like makin' love.
Well I feel like makin' love.
Well I feel like makin' love.
Feel like makin' love to you!
Well I feel like makin' love.
Well I feel like makin' love.
Well I feel like makin' love.
Feel like makin' love to you!
