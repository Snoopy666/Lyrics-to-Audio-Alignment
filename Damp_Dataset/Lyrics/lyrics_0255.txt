Come, they told me
Pa rum pa pum pum
A newborn King to see
Pa rum pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pa pum pum
To lay before the King
Pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum
So to honor Him
Pa rum pa pum pum
When we come
Little baby
Pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy, too
Pa rum pa pum pum
I have no gifts to bring
Pa rum pa pum pum
That's fit to give a King
Pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum
Shall I play for you
Pa rum pa pum pum
On my drum?
Mary nodded
Pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for Him
Pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for Him
Pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum
Then, he smiled at me
Pa rum pa pum pum
Me and my drum
