First I was afraid, I was petrified.
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side.
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you done me wrong, and I grew strong
and I learned how to get along.

And so you're back from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face.
I should have changed my stupid lock,
I should have made you leave your keys,
if I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me.

Oh now, go!
Walk out the door!
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with "goodbye"?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I!
I will survive!
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive.
And I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give
and I'll survive,

I will survive, hey, hey.

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart.
Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent so many nights feelin' sorry for myself- I used to cry,
but now I hold my head up high.

And you see me, somebody new.
I'm not that tender little person still in love with you,
and so you felt like droppin' in, and just expect me to be free,
but now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me.

Oh, now, go!
Walk out the door!
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with "goodbye"?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I!
I will survive!
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive.
And I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give
and I'll survive.
I will survive, oh...

Oh now, go!
Walk out the door!
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with "goodbye"?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I!
I will survive!
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive.
And I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give
and I'll survive,
I will survive,

I will survive!
