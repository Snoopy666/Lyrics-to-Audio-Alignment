Georgia, Georgia...
The whole day through.
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind.
I said Georgia, Georgia...
A song of you,
comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines.
Other arms reach out to me.
Other eyes smile tenderly.
Still in peaceful dreams I see, the road leads back to you.
I said Georgia,
oh Georgia...
No peace I find.
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind.
Other arms reach out to me.
Other eyes smile tenderly.
Still in peaceful dreams I see, the road leads back to you.
Woah woah, Georgia,
Georgia...
No peace, no peace I find.
Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind.
I said, just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind.
