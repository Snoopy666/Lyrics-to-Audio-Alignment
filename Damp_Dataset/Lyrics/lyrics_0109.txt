The day I first met you,
you told me you'd never fall in love.
But now that I get you,
I know fear is what it really was.
Now here we are,
so close yet so far,
haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize,
baby, I'm not like the rest!

Don't wanna break your heart,
wanna give your heart a break.
I know you're scared it's wrong,
like you might make a mistake.
There's just one life to live,
and there's no time to wait, to waste,

so let me give your heart a break.
Give your heart a break,
let me give your heart a break.

Give your heart a break, oh yeah yeah yeah.
On Sunday, you went home alone,
there were tears in your eyes.
I called your cell phone, my love,
but you did not reply.
The world is ours if you want it,
we can take it, if you just take my hand.
There's no turning back now,
Baby try to understand!

Don't wanna break your heart,
wanna give your heart a break.
I know you're scared it's wrong,
like you might make a mistake.
There's just one life to live,
and there's no time to wait, to waste,

so let me give your heart a break.
Give your heart a break,
let me give your heart a break.
Give your heart a break, there's just so much you can take.
Give your heart a break,
let me give your heart a break.

Give your heart a break, oh yeah yeah yeah.
When your lips are on my lips,
and our hearts beat as one.
But you slip out of my finger tips every time you run,

woah oh woah, woah woah woah!
So give your heart!
I know you're scared it's wrong...
To waste, so let me give your heart a break.

'Cause you've been hurt before, I can see it in your eyes,
you try to smile your way, some things you can't disguise.
Don't wanna break your heart, baby I can ease the ache, the ache.
So let me give your heart a break!
