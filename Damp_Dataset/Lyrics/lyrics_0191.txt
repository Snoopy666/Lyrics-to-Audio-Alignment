How you choose to express yourself,
it's all your own, and I can tell it comes naturally.
It comes naturally.

You follow what you feel inside,
it's intuitive, you don't have to try, it comes naturally.
Mmmmm, it comes naturally.
And it takes my breath away,
what you do so naturally.

You are the thunder and I am the lightning!
And I love the way you know who you are and to me it's exciting!

When we know it's meant to be
everything comes naturally, it comes naturally.
When you're with me, baby,
everything comes naturally, it comes naturally.
Ba- ba- baby.

You have a way of moving me,
a force of nature, your energy, it comes naturally.

what you do so naturally...

You are the thunder and I am the lightning!

When we collide, sparks fly.
When you look in my eyes,
