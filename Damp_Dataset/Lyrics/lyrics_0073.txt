If I could write you a song and make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this,
but, you probably won't,
you think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades just to hide your face and you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me.
And you never say hey or remember my name,
and it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me.


You got your high brow shoes on your feet
and you wear them around like it ain't s**t.
But you don't know the way that you look when your steps make that much noise, shhh!

I got you all figured out,
you need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are,
who do you think that you are?

You your high brow switch in your walk
and you don't even look when you pass by.
But you don't know the way that you look when your steps make that much noise, shhh!

I got you all figured out,
you need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are,
who do you think that you are?
'Cause it sure seems you got no doubt.
But we all see you got your head in the clouds.
