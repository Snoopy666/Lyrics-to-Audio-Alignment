And oh,
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.
And oh,
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly.
And oh,
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power.
I got that power.
I got that power.
I got that power, power, power, power.
They call me will-A,
stay so cool, I'm chill-ay,
I done made that mill-y,
on my way to that valet.
Used to have a piggy bank,
but now I got that bigger bank.
Who, who cares what the haters say?
They hate on me 'cause we doing what they can't.
I stay on that hustle,
I flex that mental muscle,
hate to burst your bubble,
I'm on that other level.
Imma take it higher,
and high, high, and higher,
I stay and buy attire,
keep burning like that fire.
And oh,
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.
And oh,
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly.
And oh,
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power.
I got that power.
I got that power.
I got that power, power, power, power.
Ye- ye- ye- yes, y'all,
feeling funky fresh, y'all,
work to be the best, y'all,
work good under pressure.
Been through all that stress, y'all,
get, get this off my chest, y'all,
made it out them projects with this project, that's progress, y'all.
I did it for my mama,
I told her when I was younger,
that Imma be that number one,
yup, I'll be that number one.
I take it higher,
and high, high, and higher,
I stay and buy attire,
keep burning like that fire.
What ever doesn't kill you,
only makes you stronger,
so Imma get stronger.
Call me like a batter ram, batter ram,
I'm knocking, knocking down that door again, door again.
Call, call me like a batter ram, batter ram,
I'm knocking, knocking down that door again, door again.
And oh,
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.
And oh,
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly.
And oh,
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power.
I got that power.
I got that power.
I got that power, power, power, power.
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power.
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power.
