Ooooh.
Ooooh.
Ooooh, oh oh.

You know you love me,
you know I care.
Just shout whenever and I'll be there.
You are my love,
you are my heart.
And we will never ever ever be apart.

Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin'.
We're just friends, what are you sayin'?
Said "There's another" and looked right in my eyes.
My first love broke my heart for the first time...

And I was like baby, baby, baby, oh!
Like baby, baby, baby, no!
Like baby, baby, baby, oh!
I thought you'd always be mine, mine.

Baby, baby, baby, oh!
Like baby, baby, baby, no!
Like baby, baby, baby, oh!
I thought you'd always be mine,mine.

Oh, for you I would have done whatever,
and I just can't believe we ain't together.
And I wanna play it cool,
but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring.

And I'm in pieces, baby fix me,
and just shake me 'till you wake me from this bad dream.
I'm goin' down, down, down, down,
and I just can't believe my first love won't be around...

And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh!
Like baby, baby, baby, no!
Like baby, baby, baby, oh!
I thought you'd always be mine, mine.

Baby, baby, baby, oh!
Like baby, baby, baby, no!
Like baby, baby, baby, oh!
I thought you'd always be mine, mine.

When I was thirteen, I had my first love.
There was nobody to compare to my baby,
and nobody came between us or would ever come above.
She had me goin' crazy,
oh I was starstruck.
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.

She made my heart pound,
I skip a beat when I'd see her on the street and at school on the playground.
But I really wanna see her on the weekend,
she know she got me dazin',
'cause she was so amazin'.
And now my heart is breakin',
but I just keep on sayin'...

Baby, baby, baby, oh!
Like baby, baby, baby, no!
Like baby, baby, baby, oh!
I thought you'd always be mine, mine.

Baby, baby, baby, oh!
Like baby, baby, baby, no!
Like baby, baby, baby, oh!
I thought you'd always be mine.

Now I'm all gone.
Now I'm all gone.
Now I'm all gone.
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone.
I'm gone...
