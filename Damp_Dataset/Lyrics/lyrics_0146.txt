Well you done done me in, you bet I felt it.
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted.
I fell right through the cracks.
Now I'm trying to get back.

Before the cool done run out and I'll be giving it my bestest,
and nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon it's again my turn

to win some or learn some, but
I won't hesitate no more, no more.

It cannot wait, I'm yours!
Mmm hmmm.
Mmm hmmm.

Well open up your mind and see like me.
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Ah, look into your heart and you will find love, love, love, love.

Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing.
We're just one big family,
and it's our godforsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved, love...

So I won't hesitate no more, no more.
It cannot wait I'm sure.

There's no need to complicate our time is short,
this is our fate, I'm yours.

Do cha do do do cha,
ah do cha do cha do do.
But don't you wanna come on,
scootch on over closer, dear,
and I will nibble your ear, mmm...
Zoo te ba ba bo ba bum,
wa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Wa oh oh oh oh,
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.
Ha ha.
Hm hmmmm...

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror,
and bending over backwards just to try to see ya clearer,
but my breath fogged up the glass,
and so I drew a new face and I laughed.

I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
to rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.

But I won't hesitate no more, no more.

It cannot wait I'm yours.
Oh, open up your mind and see like me,
open up your plans and, damn, you're free.
Ah, look into your heart and you will find that
the sky is yours.
So please don't, please don't, please don't.
There's no need to complicate
'cause our time is short.
This oh this oh this is all babe,
I'm yours-zah.
Bada ra pa ba ba ba ba do dee.
Do ch do do ch do do do do do do do do.
Mm mm mm mm mm...
Oh oh oh oh oh, I'm yours.
Oh oh oh oh oh, I'm yours.
