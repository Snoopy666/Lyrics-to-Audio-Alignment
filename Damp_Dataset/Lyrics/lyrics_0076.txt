Crazy, I'm crazy for feelin' so lonely.
I'm crazy, crazy for feelin' so blue.

I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted,
and then some day you'd leave me for somebody new.

Worry, why should I let myself worry?
Wonderin' what in the world did I do?

Crazy, for thinkin' that my love could hold you.
I'm crazy for tryin',
and crazy for cryin',
and I'm crazy for lovin' you.

Crazy for thinkin' that my love could hold you.
I'm crazy for tryin',
and crazy for cryin',

and I'm crazy for lovin' you.
