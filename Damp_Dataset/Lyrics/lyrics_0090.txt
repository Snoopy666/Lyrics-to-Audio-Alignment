When I got the news today, I didn't know what to say,
so I just hung up the phone.
I took a walk to clear my head,
this is where the walking lead,
can't believe you're really gone.
Don't feel like going home,
so I'm gonna
sit right here,
on the edge of this pier,
and watch the sunset disappear...
And drink a beer.
Funny how the good ones go,
too soon, but the good Lord knows,
the reasons why, I guess.
Sometimes the greater plan
is kinda hard to understand,
right now it don't make sense.
I can't make it all make sense,
so I'm gonna
sit right here,
on the edge of this pier,
and watch the sunset disappear...
And drink a beer.
So long, my friend,
until we meet again.
I'll remember you,
and all the times that we used to...
Sit right here,
on the edge of this pier,
and watch the sunset disappear...
And drink a beer.
And drink a beer.
And drink a beer, yeah, yeah, yeah
