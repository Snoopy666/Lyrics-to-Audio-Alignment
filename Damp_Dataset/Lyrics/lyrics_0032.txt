Shadows grow so long before my eyes,
and they're moving across the page.
Suddenly the day turns into night,
far away from the city.
But don't hesitate, 'cause your love won't wait, hey yeah
Oooh baby I love your way, every day.
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day.
I wanna be with you night and day, hey!
Moon appears to shine and light the sky,
with the help of some fireflies.
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine?
I can see them under the pine.
But don't hesitate, 'cause your love won't wait, hey yeah!
Oooh baby I love your way, every day.
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day.
I wanna be with you night and day, ooh yeah!
But don't hesitate, 'cause your love won't wait.
I can see the sunset in your eyes,
brown and grey, and blue besides.
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun,
wish I could buy one out of season.
But don't hesitate, 'cause your love won't wait, hey yeah!
Oooh baby I love your way, every day.
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day.
I wanna be with you night and day, hey!
Oooh baby I love your way, every day.
I wanna tell you I love your way, every day.
I wanna be with you night and day, hey!
