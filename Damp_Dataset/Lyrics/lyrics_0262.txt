I was so high I did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes,
the chaos that controlled my mind.
Whispered "goodbye," and she got on a plane,
never to return again, but always in my heart.
Oh!
This love has taken its toll on me,
she said "goodbye," too many times before.
And her heart is breaking in front of me,
and I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore.
Woah-oh-oh,
woah-oh-oh,
woah-oh-oh.
I tried my best to feed her appetite, keep her coming every night,
so hard to keep her satisfied.
Oh!
Kept playin' love like it was just a game,
pretending to feel the same, then turn around and leave again.
But oh...
This love has taken its toll on me,
she said "goodbye," too many times before.
And her heart is breaking in front of me,
and I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore.
Woah-oh-oh,
woah-oh-oh,
woah-oh-oh.
I'll fix these broken things,
repair your broken wings,
and make sure everything's alright, alright.
My pressure on your hips,
sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you, because I know that's what you want me to do.
This love has taken its toll on me,
she said "goodbye," too many times before.
And her heart is taking control of me,
and I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore.
This love has taken its toll on me,
she said "goodbye," too many times before.
And her heart is breaking in front of me,
she said "goodbye" too many times before.
Woah-oh-oh, yeah yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
