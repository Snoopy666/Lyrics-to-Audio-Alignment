There's a spark of magic in your eyes,
Candyland appears each time you smile.
Never thought that fairy tales came true,
but they come true
when I'm near you.
You're a genie in disguise,
full of wonder and surprise.
And,
betcha' by golly, wow,
you're the one that I've been waiting for, forever.
And ever will my love for you
keep growin' strong,
keep growin' strong.
If I could, I'd catch a falling star,
to shine on you so I'll know where you are.
Order rainbows in your favorite shade,
to show I love you,
thinking of you.
Write your name across the sky,
anything you ask, I'll try,
'cause,
betcha' by golly, wow,
you're the one that I've been waiting for, forever.
And ever will my love for you
keep growin' strong,
keep growin' strong.
Betcha' by golly, wow,
you're the one that I've been waiting for, forever.
And ever will my love for you
keep growin' strong,
keep growin' strong.
