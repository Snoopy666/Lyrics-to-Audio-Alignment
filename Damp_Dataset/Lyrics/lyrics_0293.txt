I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
Where the West was all but won

All alone, smokin' his last cigarette
I said, where you been?
He said, ask anything

Where were you when everything was falling apart?
And all my days were spent by the telephone

That never rang, and all I needed was a call
That never came to the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded

Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Just a little late

You found me, you found me

But in the end, everyone ends up alone
Losing her, the only one who's ever known

Who I am, who I'm not and who I wanna be
No way to know, how long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded

Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Just a little late

You found me, you found me
Early morning, the city breaks
I've been calling
For years and years and years and years and you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you?
Where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded

Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you?
Where were you?
Just a little late

You found me, you found me
Why'd you have to wait?
To find me, to find me?
