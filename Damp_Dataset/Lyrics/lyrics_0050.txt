Somethin' in the way you love me won't let me be.
I don't want to be your prisoner, so, baby, won't you set me free?
Stop playin' with my heart.
Finish what you start
when you make my love come down.
If you want me, let me know.
Baby, let it show.
Honey, don't you fool around.
Just try to understand,
I've given all I can,
'cause you've got the best of me.
Borderline, feels like I'm goin' to lose my mind.
You just keep on pushin' my love over the borderline.
Borderline, feels like I'm goin' to lose my mind.
You just keep on pushin' my love over the borderline.
Somethin' in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me.
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'till I just can't see.
But then you let me down.
When I look around,
baby, you just can't be found.
Stop drivin' me away,
I just wanna stay.
There's somethin' I just got to say.
Just try to understand,
I've given all I can,
'cause you've got the best of me.
Borderline, feels like I'm goin' to lose my mind.
You just keep on pushin' my love over the borderline.
Borderline, feels like I'm goin' to lose my mind.
You just keep on pushin' my love over the borderline.
Keep pushin' me, keep pushin' me,
keep pushin' my love!
Come on, baby.
Come on, darling, yeeeah!
Da da da da da-ah-da da da da da da da da.
You just keep on pushin' my love over the borderline!
