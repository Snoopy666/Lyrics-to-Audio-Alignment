What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
I'm goin' crazy now...

No more gas in the rig,
nothin' heard, nothin' said.
On my life, on my head,
feels like I'm goin' insane, yeah.
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you,
it can creep up inside you and consume you.
A disease of the mind, it can control you,
it's too close for comfort.

Throw on your break lights,
you're in the city of wonder, ain't gon' play nice,
watch out, you might just go under, better think twice,
your train of thought will be altered,
so if you must falter, be wise.

Your mind's in disturbia,
it's like the darkness is the light.
Am I scaring you tonight?
Ain't used to what you like.
Disturbia.

Bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum,
bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum,
bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum,
bum bum be-dum bum bum be-dum bum.

Faded pictures on the wall,
disconnectin' all the calls.
I gotta get out, or figure this s**t out,
it's too close for comfort, wow.

trying to maintain, but I'm strugglin'.
