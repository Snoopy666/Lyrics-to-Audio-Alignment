I left a note
on my bedpost,
said not to repeat
yesterday's mistakes.
What I tend to do
when it comes to you,
I see only the good,
selective memory.
The way you make me feel, yeah,
you got a hold on me, I've never met
someone so different.
Oh, here we go,
you're a part of me now,
you're a part of me,
so where you go I follow, follow, follow.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I can't remember to forget you.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I keep forgetting I should let you go.
But when you look at me,
the only memory,
is us kissing in the moonlight.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I can't remember to forget you.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
I can't remember to forget you.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
I go back again,
fall off the train,
land in his bed,
repeat yesterday's mistakes.
What I'm trying to say,
is not to forget,
you see only the good,
selective memory.
The way he makes me feel like,
the way he makes me feel, I never seemed,
to act so stupid.
Oh, here we go,
he a part of me now,
he a part of me,
so where he goes,
I follow, follow, follow.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I can't remember to forget you.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I keep forgetting I should let you go.
But when you look at me,
the only memory,
is us kissing in the moonlight.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I can't remember to forget you.
I'd rob and I'd kill to keep him with me,
I'd do anything for that boy.
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight,
I'd do anything for that boy.
I'd rob and I'd kill to keep him with me,
I'd do anything for that boy.
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight,
I'd do anything for that boy.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I can't remember to forget you.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I keep forgetting I should let you go.
But when you look at me,
the only memory,
is us kissing in the moonlight.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I can't remember to forget you.
But when you look at me,
the only memory,
is us kissing in the moonlight.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I can't remember to forget you.
