There ain't a reason you and me should be alone
tonight, yeah baby,
tonight, yeah baby.
I got a reason that you should take me home tonight.
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong.
Tonight, yeah baby,
tonight, yeah baby.
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong tonight.
It's hard to feel the rush,
to brush the dangerous.
I'm gonna run right to,
to the edge with you,
where we can both fall far in love.
I'm on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth.
Out on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment with you.
I'm on the edge, the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge.
I'm on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment with you.
I'm on the edge with you.
Another shot before we kiss the other side
tonight, yeah baby,
tonight, yeah baby.
Out on the edge is something final we call life, tonight.
Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancin' in the flames
tonight, yeah baby,
tonight, yeah baby.
Who does it hurt if everybody knows my name tonight?
It's hard to feel the rush,
to brush the dangerous.
I'm gonna run right to,
to the edge with you,
where we can both fall far in love.
I'm on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth.
Out on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment with you.
I'm on the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge.
I'm on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment with you.
I'm on the edge with you.
I'm on the edge with you.
I'm on the edge with you.
I'm on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment of truth.
Out on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment with you.
I'm on the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge,
the edge.
I'm on the edge of glory,
and I'm hangin' on a moment with you;
I'm on the edge with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
I'm on the edge with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
I'm on the edge with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
I'm on the edge with you.
With you, with you, with you, with you.
