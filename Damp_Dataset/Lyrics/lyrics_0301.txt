Another head hangs lowly, child is slowly taken.

And the violence caused such silence, who are we mistaken?
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family.
In your head, in your head they are fighting.
With their tanks, and their bombs, and their bombs and their guns.
In your head, in your head, they are crying.

In your head, in your head...
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey hey!

What's in your head?
In your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey hey hey!

Oh oh, doo, doo, doo doo.
Doo, doo, doo doo.
Doo, doo, doo doo.
Doo, doo, doo doo.


Another mother's breakin' heart is taken over.

And the violence causes silence, we must be mistaken.
It's the same old theme since nineteen sixteen.
In your head, in your head they're still fighting.
With their tanks, and their bombs, and their bombs and their guns.
In your head, in your head, they are dying.

In your head, in your head...
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey hey!

What's in your head?
In your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey hey hey.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Hey ah, ah ah oh, oh.
