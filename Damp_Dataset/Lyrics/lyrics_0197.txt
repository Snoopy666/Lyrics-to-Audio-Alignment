O holy night, the stars are brightly shining.
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.

Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
'til he appeared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Fall on your knees,
oh hear the angel voices.
O night divine,
o night when Christ was born.
O night divine,

o night, o night divine.

Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name, all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy, in grateful chorus raise we.
Let all within us praise His holy name.

Christ is the Lord,
let ever, ever praise we.
Noel, Noel,
o night, o night divine.
Noel, Noel,
o night, o night divine.
Noel, Noel,

o night, o night divine!
