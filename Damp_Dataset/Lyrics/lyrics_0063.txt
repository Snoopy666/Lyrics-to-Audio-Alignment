Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all.
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled.
They crawled out of the woodwork,
and they whispered into your brain.
They set you on a treadmill, and they made you change your name.
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind.
Never knowin' who to cling to when the rain set in.
And I would have liked to have known you but I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did.
Loneliness was tough, toughest roll you ever played.
Hollywood created a superstar, and pain was the price you paid.
Even when you died, all the press still hounded you,
all the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude.
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind.
Never knowin' who to cling to when the rain set in.
And I would have liked to have known you but I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did.
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all,
you had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled.
Goodbye Norma Jean, from the young man in the twenty-second row,
who sees you as something more than sexual,
more than just our Marilyn Monroe.
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind.
Never knowin' who to cling to when the rain set in.
And I would have liked to have known you but I was just a kid,
your candle burned out long before your legend ever did.
Your candle burned out long before the legend ever did.
