I took my love, and I took it down,
I climbed a mountain and I turned around.
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hill,
where the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart
rise above
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Oh ooooh...
Oh oh,
oh oh,
oh oooh.

Well I've been afraid of changin', 'cause I built my life around you.

But time makes you bolder, children get older,
and I'm gettin' older,
too.

So, take this love, and take it down.
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you
turn around,
and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills.
Well the landslide brought me down.
And if you
see my reflection in the snow covered hills...
Well maybe,
the landslide will bring it down.
Well, well, the landslide will bring you down.
