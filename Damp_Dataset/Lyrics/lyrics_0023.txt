O beautiful for spacious skies,
for amber waves of grain.
For purple mountain majesties,
above the fruited plain.

America! America! God shed his grace on thee.
And crown thy good with brotherhood,
from sea to shining sea.

O beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife.
Who more than self their country loved,
and mercy more than life.

America! America! May God thy gold refine.
'Til all success be nobleness,
and every gain divine.

O beautiful for patriot dream
that sees beyond the years.
Thine alabaster cities gleam
undimmed by human tears.

America! America! God mend thine every flaw!
Confirm thy soul in self-control,

thy liberty in law!
