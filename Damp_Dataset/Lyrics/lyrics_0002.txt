Have a holly jolly Christmas, it's the best time of the year
Now I don't know if they'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street, say hello to friends you know and every one you meet
Oh ho, the mistletoe, hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you, kiss him once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas, and in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year

Oh ho, the mistletoe, hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you, kiss him once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas, and in case you didn't hear

Oh by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year!
Santa Claus is comin' to town
