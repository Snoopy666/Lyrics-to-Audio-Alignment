There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy, and, God, I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor.
She sewed my new blue jeans.
My father was a gamblin' man, oh, down in New Orleans.

Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Yeah...

Mama, tell your children not to do what I have done, yeah, yeah.
Spend your lives in sin and misery, whoa, in the House of the Rising Sun.

Whoa, there is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy, and God knows I am one.
