Baby you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
Hey baby!

Yeah when I first saw that bikini top on her,
she's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water.
Thought, "Oh good Lord!", she had them long tanned legs.
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said...

Baby you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle, every little farm town with you.

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it.

So baby you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.

Well she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker.
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer.
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck, and said,
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck!"

Baby you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle, every little farm town with you.

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it.

So baby you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
When that summer sun fell to its knees,
I looked at her and she looked at me.
Then I turned on those KC Lights, and drove all night 'cause it felt so right.
Her and I, man we felt so right.
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar,
and strummed a couple chords and sang from the heart.
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin',
hell I can't get you out of my head!

Baby you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle,
every little farm town with you.

Baby you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle, every little farm town with you.

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it.


So baby you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
Come on, girl!
Get those windows down and cruise!
Awww yeah!
