So this is what you meant when you said that you were spent.
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the top.
Don't hold back.
Packin' my bags and givin' the academy a rain check.
I don't ever wanna let you down, I don't ever wanna leave this town.
'Cause after all, this city never sleeps at night.
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was.
Oh don't you understand?
I'm never changin' who I am.
So this is where you fell, and I am left to sail.
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top.
Don't look back
Turning the rags, and givin' the commodities a rain check.
I don't ever wanna let you down, I don't ever wanna leave this town.
'Cause after all, this city never sleeps at night.
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was.
Now don't you understand?
I'm never changin' who I am.
Time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was.
Now don't you understand?
I'm never changin' who I am.
This road never looked so lonely.
This house doesn't burn down slowly, to ashes, to ashes.
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was.
Now don't you understand?
I'm never changin' who I am.
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was.
Now don't you understand?
I'm never changin' who I am.
