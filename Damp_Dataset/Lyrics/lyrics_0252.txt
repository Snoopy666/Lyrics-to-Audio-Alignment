I would have given you all of my heart,
but there's someone who's torn it apart.
And he's taken just all that I had,
but if you want, I'll
try to love again.
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know...
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know,
the first cut is the deepest.
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed.
When it comes to lovin' me he's worst.
I still want you by my side,
just to help me dry the tears that I've cried.
And I'm sure gonna give you a try,
if you want, I'll
try to love again, try.
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know...
Oh,
the first cut is the deepest, baby, I know,
the first cut is the deepest.
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed.
And when it comes to loving me he's worst.
I still want you by my side,
just to help me dry the tears that I've cried.
But I'm sure gonna give you a try,
'cause, if you want, I'll
try to love again.
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know...
Oh,
the first cut is the deepest, baby, I know,
the first cut is the deepest.
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed.
And when it comes to lovin' me he's worst.
Oh,
the first cut is the deepest,
baby, I know,
the first cut is the deepest.
Try to love again.
