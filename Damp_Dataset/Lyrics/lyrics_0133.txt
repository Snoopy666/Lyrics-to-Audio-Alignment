Hush little baby, don't say a word, Papa's gonna buy you a mocking bird.
And if that mocking bird don't sing, Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

And if that diamond ring turns brass, Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.
And if that looking glass gets broke, Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat.

And if that billy goat don't pull, Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull.
And if that cart and bull turn over, Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.

And if that dog named Rover won't bark, Papa's gonna buy you a horse and cart.

And if that horse and cart fall down, you'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.
