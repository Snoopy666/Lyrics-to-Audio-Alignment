O Lord, My God,
when I in awesome wonder,
consider all the worlds Thy hands have made.
I see the stars,
I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout
the universe displayed.
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee,
how great Thou art,
how great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee,
how great Thou art,
how great Thou art.
When Christ shall come,
with shouts of acclamation,
and take me home,
what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow,
in humble adoration,
and then proclaim,
"My God, how great Thou art."
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee,
how great Thou art,
how great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee,
how great Thou art,
how great Thou art.
How great Thou art,
how great Thou art.
