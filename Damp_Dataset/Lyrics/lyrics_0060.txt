Hey hey!
Bye bye bye bye bye!
Bye bye, oh oh.
I'm doin' this tonight, you're probably gonna start a fight.
I know this can't be right, hey baby come on.
I loved you endlessly, when you weren't there for me.
So now it's time to leave, and make it alone.
I know that I can't take no more, it ain't no lie.
I wanna see you out that door, baby bye bye bye...
Don't wanna be a fool for you, just another player in your game for two.
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye bye bye!
Don't really wanna make it tough, I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye bye bye!
Just hit me with the truth, now girl you're more than welcome to.
So give me one good reason, baby come on.
I live for you and me, and now I really come to see...
that life would be much better once you're gone.
I know that I can't take no more, it ain't no lie.
I wanna see you out that door, baby bye bye bye.
Don't wanna be a fool for you, just another player in your game for two.
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye bye bye!
Don't really wanna make it tough, I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye bye bye!
I'm givin' up, I know for sure,
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more.
I'm checkin' out, I'm signin' off.
I don't wanna be the loser and I've had enough.
I don't wanna be your fool,
in this game for two.
So I'm leavin' you behind!
Bye bye bye.
Make it tough.
Bye bye, baby!
I don't wanna be your fool.
But it ain't no lie, baby bye bye bye.
Don't really wanna make it tough, I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie.
Bye bye bye!
