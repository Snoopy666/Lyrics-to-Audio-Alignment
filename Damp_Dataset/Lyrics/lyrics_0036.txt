Don't look at me.
Hmmhmmm, mmmm, haaa.
Haaa, heeeeey,
hmm.

Every day is so wonderful,
and suddenly it's hard to breathe.

Now and then I get insecure,
from all the pain, I'm so ashamed.

I am beautiful no matter what they say,
words can't bring me down.

I am beautiful in every single way,
yes, words can't bring me down.
Oh noooo oh,
so don't you bring me down today.
Hm hm hm, hm hmmm, huh huh oh.

To all your friends you're delirious,
so consumed in all your doom.

Hmmmm.
Tryin' hard to fill the emptiness, the piece is gone,

and the puzzle undone, ain't that the way it is?
You are beautiful no matter what they say,
words can't bring you down,

no nooooooo.
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way,
yes, words can't bring you down, no, nooooooo.

So don't you bring me down today.
No matter what they do,
no matter what they say,
Yeah, hey, yeah!
And everywhere we go, oh, oh, oh,

the sun will always, always, shine.
'Cause we are beautiful, no matter what they say,
yes words won't bring us down,
no noooooo!

We are beautiful in every single way,
yes words can't bring us down.
Oh noooooo,

so don't you bring me down today.
Oooooooooo, ooo, yeah.
Don't you bring me down today.
Yeaaaaah, hey-ey-ey.
Ooooooo.
Don't you bring me down, hm hmm, today.
