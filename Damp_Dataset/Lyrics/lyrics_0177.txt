It's been said and done.
Every beautiful thought's been already sung.
And I guess right now, here's another one.
So your melody will play on and on
with the best of 'em.

You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible.
A centerfold, miracle, lyrical.
You saved my life again,

and I want you to know, baby,
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
And I keep hittin' repeat -peat -peat -peat -peat -peat.

I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
And I keep hittin' repeat -peat -peat -peat -peat -peat.

Constantly, boy, you played through my mind like a symphony.
There's no way to describe what you do to me.
You just do to me
what you do.

And it feels like I've been rescued,
I've been set free.
I am hypnotized by your destiny.
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful,
you are.

And I want you to know, baby,
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
And I keep hittin' repeat -peat -peat -peat -peat -peat.

I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
And I keep hittin' repeat -peat -peat -peat -peat -peat.

No one compares, you stand alone to every record I own.
Music to my heart, that's what you are,
a song that goes on and oooooon!
I love you, I love you
like a love song, like a love song.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I - I love you like a love song, baby.
I love you, I love you like a love song.
