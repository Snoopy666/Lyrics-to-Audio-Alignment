She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve.
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the back seat.

Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline.
It'd been a long, hard year.

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention, she was goin' way too fast.
And before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin, black sheet of glass.

She saw both their lives flash before her eyes.
She didn't even have time to cry.
She was so scared.
She threw her hands up in the air.

Jesus take the wheel,
take it from my hand.
'Cause I can't do this on my own.

I'm letting go, so give me one more chance
to save me from this road I'm on.

Jesus take the wheel.

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder and the car came to a stop.
She cried when she saw that baby in the back seat sleepin' like a rock.

And for the first time in a long time, she bowed her head to pray.
She said, I'm sorry for the way I've been livin' my life.
I know I've got to change, so from now on tonight,

Jesus take the wheel,
take it from my hand.
'Cause I can't do this on my own.

I'm letting go, so give me one more chance
to save me from this road I'm on

Oh, Jesus take the wheel.

Oh, I'm letting go.
So give me one more chance.
Save me from this road I'm on,
from this road I'm on.

Jesus take the wheel.
Oh, take it, take it from me.
Oooooh...
Oooooooh...
