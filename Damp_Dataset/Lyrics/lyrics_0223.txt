I've got bipolar disorder.
My s**t's not in order.
I'm overweight,
I'm always late,
I've got too many things to say.

I rock mom jeans, cat earings.
Extrapolate my feelings.
My family is dysfunctional,
but we have a good time killing each other.
They tell us from the time we're young
to hide the things that we don't like about ourselves,
inside ourselves.
I know I'm not the only one
who's spent so long attempting to be someone else.
Well, I'm over it.

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are, secrets are.

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are, secrets are.

So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?

I can't think straight, I'm so gay.
Sometimes, I cry a whole day.
I care a lot, use an analog clock,
and never know when to stop.

And I'm passive-aggressive.
I'm scared of the dark and the dentist.
I love my butt, and won't shut up,
and I never really grew up.

So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?

Aaah aah aaah,
oh ooooh.
Oh oooh, ooooh!

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are, secrets are.

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are, secrets are.

So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are.
