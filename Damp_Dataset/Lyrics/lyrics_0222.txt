Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes,
five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear.
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes...
How do you measure, measure a year?
In daylights? In sunsets?
In midnights? In cups of coffee?
In inches? In miles?
In laughter? In strife?
In five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes,
how do you measure a year in the life?
How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love...
Seasons of love.
Seasons of love!
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes...
five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan.
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes.
How do you measure the life of a woman or a man?
In truths that she learned,
or in times that he cried.
In bridges he burned,
or the way that she died?
Oh! You got to, you got to remember the love!
You know that love is a gift from up above!
Share love! Give love!
Spread love!
Measure, measure your life in looooove!
Measure your life, measure your life in love!
