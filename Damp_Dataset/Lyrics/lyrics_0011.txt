I know that we are young
and I know that you may love me,
but I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro...
Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.
Oh, oh oh, oh oh.

She's got both hands in her pockets
and she won't look at you, won't look at you.

She hides true love, en su bolsillo.
She's got a halo 'round her finger, around you.
You know that I love you, boy,
hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point, I gotta choose, nothin' to lose.

Don't call my name, don't call my name,
Alejandro.
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe,
Fernando.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name, don't call my name,
Roberto.

Alejandro, Alejandro,
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro,

Alejandro, Alejandro,
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.

Stop, please, just let me go,
Alejandro, just let me go.

She's not broken, she's just a baby.
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad,

and all those flames that burned before him.
Now he's gonna firefight, gotta cool the bad.
You know that I love you, boy,
hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point, I gotta choose, nothin' to lose.

Don't call my name, don't call my name,
Alejandro.
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe,
Fernando.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name, don't call my name,
Roberto.

Alejandro, Alejandro,
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro,

Alejandro, Alejandro,
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.

Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro.

Bye, Fernando,
Alejandro,
Fernando.

Don't call my name, don't call my name,
Alejandro.
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe,
Fernando.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name, don't call my name,
Roberto.

Alejandro, Alejandro,
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro,

Alejandro, Alejandro,
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.

Don't call my name, don't call my name,
Alejandro.
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe,
Fernando.

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name, don't call my name,
Roberto.
Alejandro...
