If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I could take you places you ain't never been before
Baby take a chance, or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag, swag, swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eatin' fondue
I don't know about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two...
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone
And I could be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go

Tell me what you like yeah, tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't ever wanna fight, yeah you already know
I'mma make you shine bright, like you layin' in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the w-w-world ends
Make you dance, do a spin and a twirl
Voice goin' crazy on this hook like a whirl wind, swaggie
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone
And I could be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go

So give me a chance, You're all I need, girl
Spend a week wit' your boy, I'll be callin' you my girlfriend
If I was your man, I'd never leave you, girl

I just wanna love you and treat you right
Ooooh yeah, yeah
You'd never be alone
A gentleman, aah-ooh
Boyfriend, No, I'd never

Na na na, na na na, na na na, yeah girl
Na na na, na na na, If I was your boyfriend
Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na
If I was your boyfriend
