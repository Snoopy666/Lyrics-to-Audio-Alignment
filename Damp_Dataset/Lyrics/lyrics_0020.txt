We were as one baby, for a moment in time.
And seemed everlasting, that you would always be mine.

Now you wanna be free, so I'm letting you fly.

'Cause I know in my heart baby, our love will never die, no.
Woah, ooh, oh-yeah, yeah.
Boy don't you know you can't escape me.

Oooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby.

Yeah sugar.

I'm not gonna cry, no.
And I won't beg you to stay.
If you're determined to leave boy.
I will not stand in your way.

But inevitably, you'll be back again.
'Cause you know in your heart, baby,

our love will never end, no.
Oh, no, woah, woah.
No, oh no.

'Cause you'll always be my baby.
Oh, woah.

'cause you'll always be my baby.
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder, oh oh-woah-woah.
I know that you'll be right back, oh baby.
