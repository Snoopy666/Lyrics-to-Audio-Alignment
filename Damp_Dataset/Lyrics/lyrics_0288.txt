When I was young, I'd listen to the radio.
Waitin' for my favorite songs.
When they played I'd sing along.
It made me smile.
Those were such happy times, and not so long ago.
How I wondered where they'd gone.
But they're back again,
just like a long lost friend.
All the songs I loved so well.
Every Sha-la-la-la, every Whoa-oo-oo-whoa, still shines.
Every Shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine.
When they get to the part,
where he's breaking her heart,
It can really make me cry.
Just like before.
It's yesterday once more.
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by, and the good times that I had.
Makes today seem rather sad.
So much has changed.
It was songs of love that I would sing to them.
And I'd memorize each word.
Those old melodies
still sound so good to me.
As they melt the years away.
Every Sha-la-la-la, every whoa-oo- whoa-oh, still shines.
Every Shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine.
All my best memories,
come back clearly to me.
Some can even make me cry.
Just like before.
It's yesterday once more.
Every Sha-la-la-la,
every Whoa-oo-whoa-oh,
still shines.
Every Shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's
so fine.
Every Sha-la-la-la, every Whoa-oo-whoa-oh, still shines.
Every Shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine.
Still's so fine.
