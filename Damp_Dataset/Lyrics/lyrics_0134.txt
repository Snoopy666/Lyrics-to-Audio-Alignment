I used to think that I could not go on,
life was nothing but an awful song.

But now I know the meaning of true love,
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms.
If I can see it,
then I can do it.
If I can believe it,
there's nothing to it.

I believe I can fly,
I believe I can touch the sky,
I think about it every night and day,
spread my wings and fly away.
I believe I can soar,
you see me runnin' through that open door.
I believe I can fly,
I believe I can fly,

I believe I can fly.

See I was on the verge of breakin' down,
sometimes silence can seem so loud.

There are miracles in life I must achieve,
but first I know it starts inside of me, oh oh.
If I can see it,
then I can be it.
If I can believe it,
there's nothing to it.

I believe I can fly,
I believe I can touch the sky,
I think about it every night and day,
spread my wings and fly away.
I believe I can soar,
you see me runnin' through that open door.
I believe I can fly,
I believe I can fly,

I believe I can fly.
Hey, 'cause I believe in me,
Oh, oh, oh.
If I can see it,
then I can be it.
If I can believe it,
there's nothing to it.

I believe I can fly,
I believe I can touch the sky,
I think about it every night and day,
spread my wings and fly away.
I believe I can soar,
you see me runnin' through that open door.
I believe I can fly,
I believe I can fly,

I believe I can fly.
If I just spread my wings,
I can fly,
I can fly, yeah.
I can fly, hey.
If I just spread my wings,
I can fly!
Woo!
