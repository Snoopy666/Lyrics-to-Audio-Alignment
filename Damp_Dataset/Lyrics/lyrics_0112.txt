Hey good girl, with your head in the clouds,
I bet you I can tell you what you're thinkin' about.
You'll see a good boy, gonna give you the world,
but he's gonna leave you cryin' with your heart in the dirt.
His lips are drippin' honey, but he'll sting you like a bee.
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key!
Hey good girl, get out while you can,
I know you think you've got a good man.
Why?
Why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time, 'til you find...
He's no good, girl,
no good for you.
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes.
And go, go, go!
Better listen to me, he's low, low low!
Hey good girl, you got a heart of gold.
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold.
Just like you should, girl, like every good girl does,
want a fairy tale ending, somebody to love.
But he's really good at lyin', girl he'll leave you in the dust.
'Cause when he says forever, well it don't mean much.
Hey good girl, so good for him.
Better back away, honey you don't know where he's been.
Why?
Why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time, 'til you find...
He's no good, girl,
no good for you.
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes.
And go, go, go!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's low!
Yeah yeah yeah.
He's no good, girl,
why can't you see?
He'll take your heart and break it, listen to me, yeah!
Why?
Why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time, 'til you find...
He's no good!
He's no good.
Won't you open up your eyes?
It's just a matter of time, 'till you find...
He's no good girl, no good for you.
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes.
