I waited 'til I saw the sun,
I don't know why I didn't come.


Left you by the house of fun,
I don't know why I didn't come.
I don't know why I didn't come.


When I saw the break of day,
I wished that I could fly away.


'Stead of kneelin' in the sand,
catchin' teardrops in my hand.


My heart is drenched in wine,


but you'll be on my mind forever.


Out across the endless sea,
I would die in ecstasy.


But I'll be a bag of bones,
drivin' down the road alone.


My heart is drenched in wine,


but you'll be on my mind forever.






Somethin' has to make you run,
I don't know why I didn't come.


I feel as empty as a drum.
I don't know why I didn't come.
I don't know why I didn't come.
I don't know why I didn't come.
