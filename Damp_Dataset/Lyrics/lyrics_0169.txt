I had a way then, losing it all on my own.


I had a heart then, but the queen has been overthrown.
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat.
And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me.


You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone, you shine it when I'm alone.


And so I tell myself that I'll be strong, and dreamin' when they're gone.


'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home.
Calling, calling, calling home.


You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone, you shine it when I'm alone.


Noises I play with in my head.


Touch my own skin, and hope that I'm still breathin'.
And I think back to when my brother of my sister slept.
In an unknown place, the only time I feel safe.


You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone, you shine it when I'm alone.


And so I tell myself that I'll be strong, and dreamin' when they're gone.


'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home.
Calling, calling, calling home.


You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone, you shine it when I'm alone.


Lights, lights, lights, lights.
Lights, lights, lights, lights.


Lights, lights, lights, lights.
Lights, lights.


You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone, you shine it when I'm alone.


And so I tell myself that I'll be strong, and dreamin' when they're gone.


'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home.
Calling, calling, calling home.


You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone, you shine it when I'm alone.


Oh oh, oh oh oh...

Oh oh, oh oh oh...
