Tell me, what you say now?
Tell me, what you say, come again?
If you cannot stay down,
then you do not have to pretend.
Like there is no way out,
I shoulda' never let you in,
'cause you got me face down.
And don't take this personal,
but you're the worst, you know what you've done to me.
And although it hurts, I know,
I just can't keep runnin' away.

I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I don't need you,
but I want you.

I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
but I love you.

Tell me, what you say now?
Tell me, what you say?
You said that you would come again,
you said that we would remain friends, but,
you know that I do not depend on nothin' or no one.
So why would you show up so uninvited then,
just change my mind like that?
Please don't take this personal,
but you ain't s**t.
And you weren't special 'til I made you so.
You better act like you know,
that I've been through worse than you.
I just can't keep running away.

I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I don't need you,
but I want you.
But I want you.

I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
but I love you.
Whoa.

Everybody's like,
he's no item,
please don't like him,
he don't wife 'em,
he one-night's 'em.
I never listened, no.
I shoulda' figured, though.
All that s**t you was spittin', so unoriginal.
But it was you, so I was with it.
Then, to tell you the truth,
wish we never did it.
'Cause I usually do
stick to the business.
But you came out the blue,
and then you just flipped it.
God damn, baby, my mind's blown.
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone.
Think I know what this is,
just the time's wrong.
Yeah, I know what you did,
but baby, I'm grown.
And my love is patient, and kind, and s**t.
This is real, we can build through different types of s**t.
If you was really the realest,
wouldn't be fightin' it.
I think your pride is just,
in the way.
Funny how everything changed.
Once you got all that you wanted,
nothing was ever the same.

And though I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I still want you.
Ahh.

I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
but I...
But I love you.

I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I don't need you,
I don't need you,
but I want you.
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
I don't mean to,
but I love you.
