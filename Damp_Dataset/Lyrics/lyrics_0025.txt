And I am tellin' you
I'm not goin'.
You're the best man
I'll ever know,
there's no way
I can ever go.
No, no there's no way,
no, no, no, no way
I'm livin' without you.
I'm not livin'
without you.
I don't wanna be free,
I'm stayin',
I'm stayin', and you, and you...
You're gonna love me, ooh.
You're gonna love me.
And I am tellin' you,
I'm not going.
Even though there are times I'm showing,
there's just no way, there's no way.
We're part of the same place,
we're part of the same time.
We both share the same blood,
we both have the same mind.
And time and time, we've had so much to share.
No, no, no, no, no way,
I'm not wakin' up tomorrow mornin' and findin' that there's nobody there.
Darlin', there's no way.
No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you.
I'm not livin' without you,
you see there's just
no way, there's no way.
Please don't go away from me,
stay with me,
stay with me.
Stay, stay and hold me, ah yeah.
Stay, stay and hold me, ooh.
Please stay and hold me.
Listen man,
try it mister, try it mister.
I know, I know, I know you can!
Tear down the mountain, y'all scream and shout,
you can say what you want, I'm not walkin' out.
Stop all the rivers, push, strike and kill,
I'm not gonna leave you, there's no way I will!
And I am tellin' you.
Oh ah, I'm not goin'.
You're the best man I'll ever know.
There's no way I could ever, ever go.
No, no, there's no way,
no, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you.
I'm not livin' without you,
not livin' without you.
I don't wanna be free,
oh, oh, I'm stayin'
I'm stayin'.
And you,
and you,
and you,
you're gonna love me, ooh, oh yeah!
You're gonna love me,
yes you are,
yes you are.
Ooh!
Love me,
love me,
love me.
Love...
You're gonna love ...
Me!
