Ooh, ooh.
Baby love, my baby love,
I need ya', oh how I need ya'.
But all you do is treat me bad,
break my heart, and leave me sad.
Tell me, what did I do wrong,
to make you stay away so long?
'Cause baby love, my baby love,
been missin' ya',
ooh, miss kissin' ya'.
Instead of breakin' up,
let's do some kissin' and makin' up.
Don't throw our love away,
in my arms, why don't you stay?
Need ya',
need ya',
baby love, ooh, baby love.
Baby love, my baby love,
why must we separate, my love?
All of my whole life through,
I never loved no one but you.
Why do you do me like you do?
I get this need, ooh, ooh.
Need to hold ya',
once again, my love,
feel your warm embrace, my love.
Don't throw my love away,
please don't do me this way.
Not happy like I used to be,
loneliness has got the best of me,
my love,
my baby love,
I need ya', oh, how I need ya'.
Why you do me like you do,
after I've been true to you?
So deep in love with you.
Baby, baby,
ooh, 'til it's hurting me,
'til it's hurting me.
Ooh, ooh, baby love.
Don't throw our love away,
don't throw our love away...
