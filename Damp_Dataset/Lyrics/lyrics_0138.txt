Oooh, yeah, hoo!
Hey yeah, ooh ooh yeah
Uh-huh, yeah, I wanna dance

Clock strikes upon the hour, and the sun begins to fade

Still enough time to figure out how to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'till now
It's the light of day that shows me how

But when the night falls, the loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses, spinning through the town

Sooner or later the fever ends and I wind up feelin' down
I need a man who'll take a chance on a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

With somebody who loves me
Somebody who loves me yeah
To hold me in his arms
I need a man who'll take a chance on a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

With somebody who loves me
Oooh, come on baby, wooo
Yeah, get with this

Woooah, oh-oh, don't you wanna dance with me baby?
Don't you wanna dance with me boy
Hey, don't you wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

Don't you wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't you wanna dance?
Don't you wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't you wanna dance?
Don't you wanna dance, say you wanna dance?
Uh huh!
With somebody who loves me!
