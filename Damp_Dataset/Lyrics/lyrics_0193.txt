we'll be shooting stars just passing by.
You'll be coming home with me tonight,
we'll be burning up like neon lights.

Shining like stars, 'cause we're beautiful,
we're beautiful,
right now.
You're all I see in all these places,
you're all I see in all these faces.
So let's pretend we're running out of time,
of time.

we'll be shooting stars just passing by.

You'll be coming home with me tonight,
and we'll be burning up like neon lights.
