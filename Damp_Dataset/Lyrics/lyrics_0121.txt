Puting my defenses up, 'cause I don't wanna fall in love.
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack!

Never put my love out on the line,
never said yes to the right guy.
Never had trouble getting what I want,
but when it comes to you I'm never good enough.

When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll.
Won't wash my hair, and make 'em bounce like a basket ball.
But you make me wanna act like a girl, paint my nails and wear high heels.
Yes, you make me so nervous and I just can't hold your hand.

You make me glow...
But I cover up, won't let it show.

So I'm puting my defenses up, 'cause I don't wanna fall in love.

If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack!
I think I'd have a heart attack!
I think I'd have a heart attack.

Never break a sweat for the other guys,
when you come around I get paralyzed.
And every time I try to be myself,

it comes out all wrong like a cry for help.
It's just not fair, brings more trouble than it all is worth.
I gasp for air, feels so good but you know it hurts.
But you make me wanna act like a girl, paint my nails and wear perfume for you.
Make me so nervous and I just can't hold your hand.

You make me glow...
But I cover up, won't let it show.

So I'm puting my defenses up, 'cause I don't wanna fall in love.

If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack!
I think I'd have a heart attack!

I think I'd have a heart attack.
The feelings are lost in my lungs, they're burning, I'd rather be numb.
And there's no one else to blame.
So scared I'll take off in a run
I'm flying too close to the sun,
and I burst into flames!

You make me glow...
But I cover up, won't let it show.

So I'm puting my defenses up, 'cause I don't wanna fall in love.

If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack!
I think I'd have a heart attack!
I think I'd have a heart attack.

Attack!
I think I'd have a heart attack!
I think I'd have a heart attack.
