We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing,
'cause we got the fire,
and we're burning one hell of a something.
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space.
Light it up,
like we're the stars of the human race, human race.
When the light started out, they don't know what they heard,
strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world.
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky.
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire,
yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire.
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn,
we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn,
we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.
We don't wanna leave, no,
we just wanna be right now, right- right- right- right now.
And what we see,
is everybody's on the floor acting crazy, getting loco 'til the light's out.
Music's on,
I'm waking up,
we fight the fire,
then we burn it up.
And it's over now,
we got the love,
there's no sleeping now,
there's no sleeping, no sleep...
When the light started out, they don't know what they heard,
strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world.
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky.
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire,
yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire.
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn,
we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn,
we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.
When the light started out, they don't know what they heard,
strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world.
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
We can light it up, up, up,
so they can't put it out, out, out.
We can light it up, up, up,
so they can't put it out, out, out.
We can light it up, up, up,
so they can't put it out, out, out.
We can light it up, up, up,
so they can't put it out, out, out.
When the light started out, they don't know what they heard,
strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world.
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky.
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire,
yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire...
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn,
we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn,
we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.
When the light started out, they don't know what they heard,
strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world.
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky.
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire,
yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire...
And we gonna let it burn.
