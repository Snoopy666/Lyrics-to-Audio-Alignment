When the night has come and the land is dark,
and the moon is the only light we see,
no I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid,
just as long as you stand, stand by me.

So darling, darling, stand by me.
Whoa, stand by me.
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me.

If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall,
or the mountain should crumble to the sea,
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear,
just as long as you stand, stand by me.

And darling, darling, stand by me.
Whoa stand by me.
Whoa, stand now, stand by me, stand by me.


Darling, darling, stand by me.
Whoa, stand, by me.
Whoa, stand now, stand by me, stand by me.

Whenever you're in trouble you can stand by me
Whoa, stand, by me.
Whoa, stand now.
stand by me.
