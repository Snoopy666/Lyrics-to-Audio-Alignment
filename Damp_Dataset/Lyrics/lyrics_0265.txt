Baby, can't you see, I'm callin',

a guy like you should wear a warnin'.
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'.

There's no escape, I can't wait,

I need a hit, baby gimme it.
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it.
Too high, can't come down,
losin' my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round.
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride,
you're toxic, I'm slippin' under.

With a taste of a poison paradise,

I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

It's gettin' late to give you up,

I took a sip from a devil's cup.
Slowly, it's takin' over me.
Too high, can't come down,
it's in the air, and it's all around.
Can you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride,
you're toxic, I'm slippin' under.

With a taste of a poison paradise,

I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

Don't you know that you're toxic?
Ah, ah, ah, ooh.

Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride,
you're toxic, I'm slippin' under.

With a taste of a poison paradise,
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride,
you're toxic, I'm slippin' under.

With a taste of a poison paradise,
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now,
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now.
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now,
I think I'm ready now...
