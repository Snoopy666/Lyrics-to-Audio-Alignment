I don't know but I think I may be fallin' for you,
droppin' so quickly.
Maybe I should keep this to myself,
wait until I know you better.
I am trying not to tell you, but I want to.
I'm scared of what you'll say,
so I'm hiding what I'm feelin'.
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head.
I've been spendin' all my time just thinkin' 'bout you.
I don't know what to do,
I think I'm fallin' for you.
I've been waiting all my life and now I've found you.
I don't know what to do,
I think I'm fallin' for you!
I'm fallin' for you!
As I'm standin' here and you hold my hand,
pull me towards you, and we start to dance.
All around us, I see nobody,
here in silence, it's just you and me.
I'm trying not to tell you, but I want to.
I'm scared of what you'll say,
so I'm hiding what I'm feelin'.
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head.
I've been spendin' all my time just thinkin' 'bout you.
I don't know what to do,
I think I'm fallin' for you.
I've been waiting all my life and now I've found you.
I don't know what to do,
I think I'm fallin' for you!
I'm fallin' for you!
Oh I just can't take it,
my heart is racin',
emotions keep spinnin' out.
I've been spendin' all my time just thinkin' 'bout you.
I don't know what to do,
I think I'm fallin' for you.
I've been waiting all my life and now I've found you.
I don't know what to do,
I think I'm fallin' for you!
I'm fallin' for you!
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout it,
I want you all around me,
and now I just can't hide it.
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout it,
I want you all around me,
and now I just can't hide it.
I think I'm fallin' for you!
I'm fallin' for you!
Oh, oh no no,
oh woah woah oh,
and now I'm fallin' for you.
