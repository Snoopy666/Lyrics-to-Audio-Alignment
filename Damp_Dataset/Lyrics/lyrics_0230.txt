When the truth is found
to be lies,
and all the joy
within you dies.
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love,
love.
When the garden flowers
baby, are dead, yes and
your mind, your mind,
is so full of red.
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you want somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love.
Your eyes, I say, your eyes may look like his.
Yeah, but in your head baby,
I'm afraid you don't know where it is.
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love.
Tears are running, down around down your dress.
And your friends, baby,
they treat you like a guest.
Don't you want somebody to love?
Don't you need somebody to love?
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love.
