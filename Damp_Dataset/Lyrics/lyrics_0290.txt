Another day has gone,
I'm still all alone.
How could this be?
You're not here with me.
You never said goodbye.
Someone tell me why
did you have to go
and leave my world so cold?
Every day I sit and ask myself
how love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says...

But you are not alone,
I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart.
You are not alone,

'lone, alone.
Why, 'lone?

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry,
asking me to come
and hold you in my arms.
I can hear your prayers,
your burdens I will bear,
but first I need your hand,
then forever can begin.
Every day I sit and ask myself, did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says...

That you are not alone,
I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
You are not alone, I am here with you.
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart.
For you are not alone.
Oh...

Whisper three words and I'll come running.
And I...
And girl, you know that I'll be there,
I'll be there.

You are not alone,
I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
You are not alone, I am here with you.
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart.

You are not alone,
I am here with you.
Though you're far away, you and me.
You are always in my heart-heart-heart!
Not alone, oh.

You are not alone, you are not alone.
Say it again.
You are not alone,
you are not alone.
Not alone,
not alone.
You just reach out for me, girl, 
in the morning,
in the evening.
Not alone,
not alone,
you and me,
not alone,
no!
