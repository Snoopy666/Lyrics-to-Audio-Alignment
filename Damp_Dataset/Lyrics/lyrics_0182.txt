I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors, I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops.
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver, don't know what I did next, all I know, I couldn't stop.
Word got around to the bar flies and the baptists, my mama's phone started ringing off the hook.
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it, don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look.
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up,
run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart.
This ain't my mama's broken heart.
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic, like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames.
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches when the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame.
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation,
sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make.
My mama came from a softer generation, where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face.
and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up,
run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart.
This ain't my mama's broken heart.
Powder your nose, paint your toes, line your lips, and keep 'em closed.
Cross your legs, dot your eyes, and never let 'em see you cry.
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up,
run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart.
This ain't my mama's broken heart.
