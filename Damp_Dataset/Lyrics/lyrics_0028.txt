I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong.
To crash the critics saying, "is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an I.V., baby could I bear...
being away from you, I found the vein, put it in here.
I live for the applause, applause, applause.
I live for the applause, 'plause,
live for the applause, 'plause.
Live for the...
Way that you cheer and scream for me.
The applause, applause, applause.
Give me the thing that I love.
I'll turn the lights on.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch.
Make it real loud.
Give me the thing that I love.
I'll turn the lights on.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch.
Make it real loud.
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch.
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch.
I've overheard your theory, "Nostalgia's for geeks."
I guess, sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read.
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me.
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture in me.
I live for the applause, applause, applause.
I live for the applause, 'plause,
live for the applause, 'plause.
Live for the...
Way that you cheer and scream for me.
The applause, applause, applause.
Give me the thing that I love.
I'll turn the lights on.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch.
Make it real loud.
Give me the thing that I love.
I'll turn the lights on.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch.
Make it real loud.
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch.
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch.
Ooooh, touch, touch.
Touch, touch.
I live for the applause, applause, applause.
I live for the applause, 'plause,
live for the applause, 'plause.
Live for the...
Way that you cheer and scream for me.
The applause, applause, applause.
Give me the thing that I love.
I'll turn the lights on.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch.
Make it real loud.
Give me the thing that I love.
I'll turn the lights on.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch.
Make it real loud.
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch.
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E.
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch.
A-R-T-P-O-P.
