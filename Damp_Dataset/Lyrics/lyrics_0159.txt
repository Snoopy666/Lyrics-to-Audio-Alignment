Strumming my pain with his fingers,
singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song.

I heard he sang a good song.
I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him and listen for a while.
And there he was, this young boy,
a stranger to my eye.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Tellin' my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.

I felt all flushed with fever,
embarrassed by the crowd.
I felt he'd found my letters, and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish,
but he just kept right on...

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Tellin' my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.

Woah oh oh,
woah oh, oh, oh oh.
La la la, la la la.
Oh oh oh, ah ah ah.
Woah oh oh.
Laaah...
La ah ah, ah ah, ah ah.
ming my pain...
Yes, he was singin' my life.
Killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Tellin' my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.Keep drinkin' coffe, stare me down across the table while I look outside.
So many things I'd say if only I were able,
but I just keep it quiet and count the cars that pass by.
You've got opinions, man,
we're all entitled to 'em.
But I never asked.
So let me thank you for your time, and try not to waste any more of mine.
And get out of here fast.
I hate to break it to you babe, but I'm not drowning.
There's no one here to save.
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me,
who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Oh oh oh oh.
You sound so innocent,
all full of good intent,
you swear you know best.
But you expect me to jump up on board with you,
and ride off into your delusional sunset.
I'm not the one who's lost,
with no direction, oh, but you'll never see.
You're so busy makin' maps with my name on them in all caps.
You got the talking down, just not the listening.
And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me,
who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
All my life I've tried to make everybody happy while I just hurt and hide.
Waitin' for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide.
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me,
who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Oh who cares if you disagree?
You are not me,
who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Let me hold your crown, babe.
Oh oh, oh oh oh.
Ah ah ah ah.
