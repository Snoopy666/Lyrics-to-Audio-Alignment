Uh huh huh.

If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea,
I'll sail the world to find you.

If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see,
I'll be the light to guide you.
Find out what we're made of
when we are called to help our friends in need.

You can count on me like one, two, three, I'll be there.
And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two, and you'll be there
'cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah.
Ooooh.
Oooooh, oooh, yeah.

If you're tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep,
I'll sing a song beside you.

And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me,
every day I will remind you. Oh.
Find out what we're made of
when we are called to help our friends in need.

You can count on me like one, two, three, I'll be there.
And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two, and you'll be there
'cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah.
Ooooh.
Oooooh, oooh, yeah.

You'll always have my shoulder when you cry.
I'll never let go, never say goodbye.

You can count on me like one, two, three, I'll be there.
And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two, and you'll be there

'cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah.
Ooooh.
Oooooh, oooh.
You can count on me, 'cause I can count on you!
