Step one, you say we need to talk, he walks

You say sit down, it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through some sort of window to your right
As he goes left, and you stay right bettween the lines
Of fear and blame, you begin to wonder wht you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

And I would have stayed up with you all night

Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best

Try to slip past his defence, without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
Things you told him all along
Pray to god he hears you, and pray to god he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

And I would have stayed up with you all night

Had I known how to save a life


As he begins to raise his voice, you lower yours, and give him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road, or break with the ones you followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he'sjust not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

And I would have stayed up with you all night

Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

And I would have stayed up with you all night

Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
