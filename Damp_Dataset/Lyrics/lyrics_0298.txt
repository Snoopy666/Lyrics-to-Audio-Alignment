I spent all my money on a big old fancy car,
for these bright-eyed honies, oh yeah, you know who you are.
Keep me up 'til the sun is high, 'til the birds start calling my name.
I'm addicted and I don't know why, guess I've always been this way.
All these roads steer me wrong, but I still drive them all night long, all night long.
All you young, wild girls, you make a mess of me.
yeah you young, wild girls, you'll be the death of me.
The death of me.
All you young, wild girls, no matter what you do.
Yeah you young, wild girls, I'll always come back to you.
Come back to you.
I get lost under these lights, I get lost in the words I say.
Start believin' my own lies, like everything will be okay.
Oh I still dream of a simple life,
boy meets girl, makes her his wife.
But love don't exist when you live like this, that much I know.
Yes I know.
All these roads steer me wrong, but I still drive them all night long, all night long.
All you young, wild girls, you make a mess of me.
yeah you young, wild girls, you'll be the death of me.
The death of me.
All you young, wild girls, no matter what you do.
Yeah you young, wild girls, I'll always come back to you.
Come back to you, you, you.
You, you you.
Yeah you, you, you.
You, you, you.
All you young, wild girls, you make a mess of me.
Yeah you young, wild girls, you'll be the death of me.
The death of me.
All you young, wild girls, no matter what you do.
Yeah you young, wild girls, I'll always come back to you.
Come back to you.
