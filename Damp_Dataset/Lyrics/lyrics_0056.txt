You'll say, that we've got nothing in common,
no common ground to start from,
and we're falling apart.
You'll say, the world has come between us,
our lives have come between us,
still I know you just don't care.
And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffanny's?"

and I hate when things are over,
when so much is left undone.

She said, "I think I remember the film
and as I recall I think we both kind of liked it."
And I said, "Well that's the one thing we've got."
