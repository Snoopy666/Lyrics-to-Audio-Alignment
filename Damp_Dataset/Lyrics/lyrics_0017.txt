I used to cry myself to sleep at night,
but that was all before he came.
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right,
but now he's here
it's not the same,
it's not the same.
He fills me up,
he gives me love,
more love than I've ever seen.
He's all I've got,
he's all I've got in this world,
but he's all the man that I need.
And in the morning when I kiss his eyes,
he takes me down
and rocks me slow.
And in the evening when the moon is high,
he holds me close
and won't let go,
he won't let go.
He fills me up,
he gives me love,
more love than I've ever seen.
He's all I've got,
he's all I've got in this world,
but he's all the man that I
need,
need.
Ooh.
Oo-oh oo-oh ooh,
oo-oh,
ooh.
Woo, ooh.
Woo, oo-oh.
He fills me up,
he gives me love,
more love than I've ever seen.
He's all I've go-o-o-ot,
he's all I've got in this world,
but he's all the man that I need.
He fills me up,
he gives me love,
more more love, more love, more love, more love...
He's all I've got,
he's all I've got in this world,
but he's all the man,
all the man...
Woo.
