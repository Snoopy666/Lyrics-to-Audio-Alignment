Let's just stop...
There's nothing you can do or say,
baby.
I've had enough,
I'm not your property as from today,
baby.
You might think that I won't make it on my own...
But now I'm stronger than yesterday,
now it's nothin' but a mile away,
my loneliness ain't killing me no more.
I'm, I'm stronger,
than I ever thought that I could be,
baby.
I used to go with the flow,
didn't really think about me.
You might think that I can't take it,
but you're wrong.
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday,
now it's nothin' but a mile away,
my loneliness ain't killing me no more.
I'm, I'm stronger!
Come on, now.
Oh yeah,
here I go, on my own.
I don't need nobody, better off alone.
Here I go, on my own, now.
I don't need nobody, not anybody.
Here I go.
Alright.
Here I go.
Stronger than yesterday,
it's nothing but a mile away.
My loneliness ain't killing me no more.
I'm, I'm
stronger!
Now it's nothing but a mile away.
My loneliness ain't killing me no more.
Now I'm stronger than yesterday,
now it's nothing but a mile away.
My loneliness ain't killing me no more.
I, I'm,
stronger!
