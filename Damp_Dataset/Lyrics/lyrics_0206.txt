It's nine o'clock on a Saturday,
the regular crowd shuffles in.
There's an old man sitting next to me,
making love to his tonic and gin.
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes.
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete,
when I wore a younger man's clothes."
Oh la la la de de da,
la la de de da da dum.
Sing us a song, you're the piano man,
sing us a song tonight.
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody,
and you've got us feeling alright.
Now, John at the bar is a friend of mine,
and he gets me my drinks for free,
and he's quick with a joke,
and he'll light up your smoke,
but there's some place that he'd rather be.
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me,"
as the smile ran away from his face.
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star,
if I could get out of this place."
Oh, la la la de de da,
la la de de da da dum.
Now, Paul is a real estate novelist,
who never had time for a wife.
And he's talking with Davy,
who's still in the navy,
and he probably will be for life.
And the waitress is practicing politics,
as the businessmen slowly get stoned.
Yeah, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness,
but it's better than drinking alone.
Sing us a song, you're the piano man,
sing us a song tonight.
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody,
and you've got us feeling alright.
Well, it's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday,
and the manager gives me a smile.
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see,
to forget about life for a while.
And the piano sounds like a carnival,
and the microphone smells like beer,
and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar, and say,
"Man, what are you doing here?"
Oh, la la la de de da,
la la de de da da dum.
Sing us a song, you're the piano man,
sing us a song tonight,
well, we're all in the mood for a melody,
and you've got us feeling alright.
